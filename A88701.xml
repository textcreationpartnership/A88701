            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough (ſo far as I know mine own deceitful heart) <hi>I</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with none but ſuch as differ with Chriſt; yet are there many differences between me and many, even ſome of them ſuch as are eminently holy. And many times I am apt to think that they do not deal wel with me, nor as it becometh chriſtians: yea ſometimes I expreſs ſo much, but it little moveth diſcourſe of them, for the Lord hath hid me from them; it would be to me even an heart-breaking affliction, were it not that my hope is that God wil uncover me again in due time, and give me favour in the eyes of his excellent ones, in whom is all my delight. This following Treatiſe is the ſubſtance of divers Sermons preached by me in a time of great troubles, when innumerable evils came upon me, which much dejected me: I confeſſe I wanted a <hi>Luther</hi> to chide me; for that holy champion writing to <hi>Melancthon</hi> a godly learned man, yet too much dejected, hath theſe words, I <hi>vehemently hate thoſe most miſerable cares, wherewith thou art even conſumed; it is not the greatneſs of the cauſe, but of our unbelief; if the cauſe be falſe, let us give it over, if true, why do we make him, (to wit, God) a lyar in ſo great promiſes? strive against thy ſelf the greatest enemy, &amp;c.</hi> and although the difference be great betweene him and me, and (as many whom I cannot but love and honour may think) between his cauſe and mine; yet I humbly crave leave to affirm that it is evident to me it is the ſame, though not by me ſo wel, diſcreetly, &amp; inoffenſſively managed. For much of trouble comes by my differing in judgment from ſome, whoſe lives <hi>I</hi> cannot tax; and although they do mine; yet if hear-ſay and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies did not too much prevaile, and men would take up no more for truth then what is proved, <hi>I</hi> would ſtand higher in the hearts of ſome (<hi>I</hi> am confident) then now <hi>I</hi> do. But for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of mine enemies (which are to me yet far leſs grievou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) they are the prophane and ungodly, which are enemies to all ſuch as truly fear God.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168364:5"/>
            <p>If it ſhould be the will of my gracious Father to call me out of this mortal life, as things now ſtand with me and concerning me, I ſhould not dye eſteemed, nor much regarded by ſuch as have been my great friends formerly, and ſhall by me ſtill be numbred among the beſt of men. It is not my lot alone to be leſſe beloved of ſuch as were beſt loved of me. God will ſtain the pride of fleſh: <hi>Nos quoque flor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imus. I</hi> make of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich written to famous Biſhop <hi>Jewel:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Olim diſcipulus mihi parve Juelle, fuiſti.</l>
                  <l>Nunc ero diſcipulus te renuente, tenus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Tis pretty (for all that) to ſee how gravely ſome young men (born ſince the Lord put me in the Miniſtry firſt) do carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Surely the Britiſh Britiſh Prieſts mentioned by <hi>Bede,</hi> would be ready to think and ſay of them as the old Eremite had taught them concerning <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, ſent over by the Pope to reduce the Clergy of England to the Romiſh yoke: But I hope the Lord will keep me from a diſcontented ſpirit, and envious eye. Though I am low and under many afflictions, yet bleſſed be God that it goeth ſo well with his people for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality as it doth, and with the publicke. The conſideration of that I truſt, will quiet my grumbling ſoule, and ſwallow up my private afflictions, which are many, &amp; have been of ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and are like to continue ſo long as any limb or part of Antichriſt (though but his little toe) remaineth. But come what will, my mercies are, will be more then my afflictions, yet <hi>I</hi> wiſh mine advanced (once <hi>I</hi> durſt call them) brethren, would not be too rigid beyond rule. Arbitrary power hath not ſtood long in any; let laws be obſerved towards us as we are Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Chriſts rules as we are Chriſtians and Brethren; and then ſome others as well as <hi>I,</hi> that have ſhared in the common afflictions of Gods people, and the common wealth; and have been in the number of inſtruments made uſe of by God in the day of <hi>Iacobs</hi> trouble; ſhal finde fairer dealing then we doe. It is not meant that the earth ſhould cover our blood, or you wink at our ſinnes; but that you would not make your
<pb facs="tcp:168364:5"/> ſelves wiſer then known wholſome Laws, nor more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in matters of religious concernment, then the perfect rule of Chriſtians, the Scriptures of God doe require and warrant you in. I confeſſe it was very grievous to me, that had been ſo toſt from poſt to pillar, in the time of the Prelacy, put into Star-chamber and High-Commiſſion at one time. A Petition delivered to the Kings own hand againſt me with twenty four terrible Articles annexed, importing Faction, Hereſie, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, Rebellion and treaſon: Articles in the conſiſtory at <hi>Exeter,</hi> at the ſame time under a ſuit of pretended ſlander for reproving an atheiſtical wretch, by that name of Atheiſt at the ſame time: Purſſevants, or meſſengers, one upon the back of another, no leſſe then five at ſeveral times: Now when the Lord had given his people reſt, and advanced ſome to places of power, to be dealt withall more illegally and irregularly then in thoſe ſad times before hinted. But I confeſſe it was by ſuch as either then were in their Coats, or under the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters Ferula; or dawbing with untempered morter, and ſerving the times, if they were then come into the world in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. <hi>How doeſt thou my Brother?</hi> and <hi>Haile Maſter,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but run in my minde, when I conſider how one Cringed to me, and after thanked me for my pains I took upon an occaſion, &amp;c. and yet ſecretly had an information of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twelve years age, to make me Odious: O my God, lay it not to his charge: And although I have not ſo great a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in wealth or honour, as many (once far below me) have attained unto; yet I acknowledge God is afore-hand with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e aboundantly. I have ſwimmed through a ſea of mercies, and ſhall not that Ocean ſwallow a few diſcourteous dealings? This God (whom I here hold forth under ſuch glorious attributes as the Scripture gives him) is my God, and was my (iminently godly) Fathers God, even while he lived, and I have great cauſe to ſay, he is already my childrens God, and I truſt will be the God of (not onely) them, but their children alſo, even ſo, Amen.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe, comes under many diſadvantages unto the view of the reader. Notes taken, of what was publickly preached, onely over-looked by me, the looked and over-ſeen Author;

And yet <hi>I</hi> am of an opinion ſome will get ſome good; and may make uſe of this rough-hewed untrimed piece: There was great calling upon me for it, by many that heard it, before I could be perſwaded to give it a let-paſſe: And now that it is abroad, God grant, that no ſpirit of prejudice againſt the Authors perſon, may hinder the profiting any reader hereof; It is a ſubject I confeſſe, ſome have written of already, which yet I ſaw not (all at leaſt) untill mine was finiſhed: And I perceive I have rambled in a method of mine own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very apt to ſtep aſide to ſpeake with any God ſends my ſpirit unto in my preaching: as the reader will quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. But 'tis as 'tis. <hi>Quod factum eſt infectum fieri nequis.</hi> Charge not on me the miſtaken words or ſentences, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointings and faults in Orthography, which abound, but correct with thy Pen, or cover with thy candid ingenuity, what thou findeſt amiſſe: As for ſuch, as are ready to deprave the labours of others, though they cannot or will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce better of their own: I wiſh them better ſpirits; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying ſo dear for their follys as I have for mine. And ſo I commend this Treatiſe to Gods bleſſing and thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; And if thou wilt needs have low thoughts of it, or of the Author, know that thou comeſt too late to be the firſt in order of that ſort of men, among whom is firſt and chiefeſt already.</p>

            <p>I ſhall premiſe ſome General things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that theſe communicable Attributes are ſuch as of which ſomething anological is to be found in Creatures, I do not mean that thoſe Attributes of God are themſelves communicated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, but that the like effects are beheld in Creatures.</p>

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:168364:14"/>
            <p>The firſt that I ſhall ſpeak of is of the Attribute of life, which ſeems to be the firſt in order. This is communicated to the ſons of Men (with other creatures) not only the knowledg thereof, and of the other Attributes communicable; for ſo the incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones alſo are imparted to the ſons of Men to be known, and conſidered by them: But the being of them at leaſt analogically, as hath been already ſhewed.</p>
            <p>But that I may not preach without a Text, let us make way to the words read unto you, and ſo find out (as God ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſiſt) the mind of the Spirit in them, and ſo come to that one word in which this firſt attribute of life is held forth.</p>
            <p>Know therefore that the Author of this profound Epiſtle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet before the eyes of theſe Hebrews or Jews to whom he writes, the obſtinacy of their Fathers doth now make applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to them that were now alive, in this Verſe read unto you.</p>
            <p>Which I may call a prohibitive propoſition, or dehortation, or concluſion of the Argument formerly handled. As if he ſhould ſay, your Fathers hardned their hearts of old, and provoked God to their own deſtruction, take heed therefore that ye do not do ſo,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> to your deſtruction alſo.</p>
            <p>The word, take heed or ſee, or beware, is often uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 5.15. <hi>See then that ye walk circumſpectly. Colloſ:</hi> 2.8. <hi>Beware lest any man ſpoile you through Philoſophie.</hi> Though the word do hold forth an act of the eye, which is in the head, yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle means the circumſpection of the heart.</p>
            <p>The thing or matter which he would have them take heed of is <hi>an evil heart of unbeliefe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An evill heart of unbeleefe the fountaine of all evill.</note> which is indeed the fountain of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. And then the heart is ſaid to be evil when it hath in it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, unbelief in the heart makes the heart to be an evil heart. What's the reaſon men refuſe to hear Gods Word, to obey his will, and in ſtead thereof malitiouſly oppoſe him? Is is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not believe him. Do not men (I meane wicked men) make God a lyar in all that he ſaith? Let God ſay what he will, whether by promiſes or threats, yet they ſhew that they do not beleeve any thing of it; they eſteeme it as the ſong of fools. And among all the Truths which the Spirit holds forth, what is ſo ſweet as this, that God ſent his Son into the world to ſave Mankind? And now then what is the reaſon men be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168364:14"/> by him, (more I mean then be;) becauſe they do not beleeve the teſtimony that God gave of his Son. At your leiſure you may read 1 <hi>John</hi> 5, 10, 11, 12 verſes; There ye may ſee life and ſalvation is to be had by Chriſt, (and indeed no other way,) and men have it not becauſe they receive not the offer. <hi>He that beleeveth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now if men would beleeve, they ſhould be ſaved. So that Faith is that divine Grace that doth ſubmit to the command of Beleeving,<note place="margin">What Faith is</note> and doth give glory to God. As the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did when ſhe was told ſhe ſhould have a Child, ſhe ſubmitteed to it; <hi>Luke</hi> 1.38. <hi>And Mary ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Handmaide of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word.</hi> So ſaith God, I did ſend my Son to dye for you, and he hath been crucified for you; and I am well-pleaſed with his all-ſufficient ſacrifice for you. Why do ye not make application of it to your own ſouls? ſurely it is an evil heart of unbeleefe which is the mother of all miſchief and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>And here by the way ye ſee that a heart poſſeſt with unbeleef is an evil heart, and this is that that cauſeth us to depart from the living God; and therefore the Author of this Epiſtle doth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly warn theſe Hebrews to fly from unbeleefe.</p>
            <p>But how can it be ſaid that unbeleevers depart from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, ſeeing they were ever from God a far off, ſtrangers,<label type="milestone">

And the Lord will pour out his vengeance upon the Nations that have not known him, and upon the Families that have not called on his name.

               </note> There are two ſorts of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; there are ſome which every man ſtands bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168364:15"/> as he is a creature; and ſome which men ſtand bound to perform by poſitive commands,<note place="margin">Three ſorts of poſitive duties</note> whether the duties be moral, or poſitive, and of thoſe that be poſitive; whether they be ceremonial or Judicial, or evangelical, to whom the command comes, from them is obedience due to the great and Soveraign Law-giver: and not to perform it, is to depart from God; that is, to diſown God, to run away from his ſervice, to ſay in effect we wil not be under his command. They that do not cal upon God, depart from God, that is,<note place="margin">Not to come Chriſt, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Chriſt.</note> they depart from his commands, ſuch as profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be chriſtians, and living under invitations to come to Chriſt, &amp; do not come to him to have life by him, they do depart from him in ſcripture phraſe; and all this cometh from a heart of unbeliefe. O this trampling under-foot the blood of Chriſt, is a very great ſin. Beloved: ye do here profeſſe your ſelves to be Chriſtians, what do ye make here elſe to day? Now if ye believe not God, and his word to walk anſwerable, what do yee elſe but depart from the living God? ye depart from this invitation to take his Son, from his Commandement to beleeve, to kiſſe the Son, from his holy injunctions, for which if ye repent not, God wil moſt certainly damn you; for ye are both Creatures, and in name Chriſtians, and therefore take heed leſt there be in any of you a heart of unbeliefe to depart from the Living God.</p>
            <p>I have diſpatched the manner and matter of the Exhortation, I now am to ſpeak of the deſcription of God by the Attribute of Life; God in my Text (ye ſee) called <hi>the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In each Attribute that I ſhal ſpeak of I purpoſe to do theſe three things, firſt to ſhew you that ſuch an Attribute (as here Life which is the firſt to be ſpoken of) is an Attribute of God; ſecondly, that it is communicable to Man-kind;<note place="margin">Reaſons of the attribute of Life.</note> thirdly, that God in each of them (and in this of Life) is infinite and incomprehenſible.</p>
            <p>Know then that <hi>God</hi> (which all muſt take heed they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from) <hi>is a Living God;</hi> for the proof of it read <hi>Dan:</hi> 6, 29. 1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.9. <hi>Heb:</hi> 9.14. in al which places he is called <hi>the living God</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is called the living God for divers reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe he liveth of himſelf, and that everlaſtingly, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 102.64. <hi>Thy years are through all generations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and ver: 27. <hi>but thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall have no end.</hi> God alwayes hath been, and wil be for ever. Never was there, nor never wil there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168364:15"/> be the leaſt point of time, in which it might, or ſhal be ſaid, God is not the living God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, every creature hath his life from God, he is the creator of Life unto us all, and all living things, <hi>Act:</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him we live, moove, and have our being.</hi> He is the fountain and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of all Life. Get ye up as high as ye can, and ſuppoſe the world were ten thouſand times older then it is, yet at laſt there muſt be a ſtop, <hi>Luke</hi> in his third Chapter carrieth along the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Jeſus Chriſt as far as ever he could poſſibly, even unto <hi>Adam,</hi> one was the ſon of another, but at laſt it is ſaid, which was the Son of God; there we muſt ſtop, we can go no further. 3. God is called the Living God; becauſe he giveth life to his promiſes, but this is not ſo proper to this matter.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. He giveth Grace to his Elect; this is called <hi>the life of God, Epheſ:</hi> 4.18. But to keep to the Attribute I am upon, and to the two former Reaſons of this Attribute; and yet more eſpetially to the firſt. It is neceſſary that I ſhould firſt ſhew you what that thing is which we cal life, &amp; then we ſhal the better underſtand what is meant by Life as it is attributed to God; for in ſaying God is love, or God is a conſuming fire, or any other analogical expreſſion, it is needful that ye know what thoſe things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>Life therefore is ſelf-motion naturally, that which moveth of it ſelf from an inward cauſe, be it what it be, that is ſaid to live or thus, Life is a vital ſpirit by which al quick things move therefore Beaſts, Birds, fiſh, and creeping things are called living ſouls, or living Creatures, <hi>Gen:</hi> 2.19.20. Other things that move from outward cauſes, as clocks, watches, carts, or coaches, are not ſaid to live, becauſe they do not move from an inward principle. And elements though they move naturally, yet it is only to their proper place: heavy elements move downward, and light elements upward: And this natural motion they keep, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be reſtrained as water in a Veſſel.</p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of quick, or living creatures.</p>
            <p>Firſt, plants do hold the loweſt degree of life, they do indeed live of themſelves, yet neither know the end of their motion, neither do they prepare for it, they ſend forth their moares and roots to get moiſture, and nouriſhment, but they know not that, they do ſo.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168364:16"/>
            <p>Secondly, there is a degree of life ſomewhat higher then this which is the life of ſenſitive creatures, theſe firſt move of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, therefore are ſaid to live; ſecondly, they of themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome form by ſence, which is the ground or beginning of their motion; but of themſelves they know not the end of their motion formally, neither do they propound it unto themſelves diſtinctly; but ſomerime break their neck, when according to their inſtinct they move to good; they move to get better feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being led by ſence, but becauſe they want reaſon to guide them; they meet with miſery often, and therefore it is, that men that are fooliſh, are ſaid to be unreaſonable men, and bruit Beaſts, becauſe they are better like beaſts, then like men endued with reaſon; yea all men in the fallen condition of <hi>Adam</hi> are ſaid to be like the Beaſts that periſh. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 49. <hi>v:</hi> laſt. <hi>Man that is in honor and underſtandeth not, is like the Beaſts that periſh.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, There is a life of intellectual and rational creatures which cometh neereſt to the life attributed to God. For firſt, ſuch as live this life get intentional forms, by which they variouſly are moved, and this proceeds from this life of theirs. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they that live this life know the end of their moving formally. And thirdly, by themſelves do propound unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ends of their motions, and actions, and move and act with diſcretion, and determine of things upon conſidetation. The life of man far excels the life of other creatures, and yet it comes ſhort of the life of Angels who are alſo the living ſons of God by temporal creation; <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. <hi>Now there was a day when the Sons of God came to preſent themſelves before the Lord;</hi> If we

Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul doth not only live in the body, but out of the body, for although the ſoule be the firſt act of a natural inſtrumental body, eminently containing all the vertues of a vegetative, and ſenſitive ſoul; yet over and above theſe, it hath three ſpiritual powers not bound to the body; an intellect acting, an intellect in poſſibility of acting, and a wil: by which ye may ſee the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a reaſonable ſoul above a vegetative, and ſenſitive, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which hath all its powers bound to an organical body, and ceaſeth to be when it is ſeparated from the body.<note place="margin">Corrupto compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito utra<expan>

            <p>Now both thoſe wayes God is a Living God (excepting thoſe imperfections that attend creature-life.) For he is not only Life, but the firſt Life, and eternal Life, and the very fulneſs, and univerſality of Life, the original of all Life, &amp; the conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, the beginning, and the end; in whom even all things which do not live are Life.

And this is the firſt thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in Life, to wit, its vital ſubſtance. Now ſecondly, God is himſelf his vital operation, to wit, his underſtanding, his Love, his joy, his bleſſednes. From that ſupernatural fountaine all things which any way do live, do draw Life, even thence the life of plants, brutes, Men, and Angels, all Life natural, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, of this Life, and the Life to come, Temporal, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</p>
            <p>But eſpetially by life in God is underſtood his underſtanding and wiſedom; for this is the firſt and chiefe life, and vital ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, from whence all other life doth proceed. Therefore the wiſdom of God is the life of all things, and by it God liveth to himſelf, and to all things, and all things live unto him, and are preſent and ſhine, and immutably perſevere in him from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to eternity.</p>
            <p>Yet life is not in God as in creatures, for in them the ſoule is the cauſe of life (as hath been ſaid) and life the motion, but thoſe in God are not ſo diſtinct. Life is not attributed to God, and creatures univocally, but analogically. Nor indeed can any thing be ſaid of God and creatures univocally. As when I ſay God is angry, or God is love, or that he hath no pleaſure in wick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ednes,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168364:17"/> ſome there are that think that whatſoever is attributed to God in ſcripture, is ſpoken properly of him, and of the creature by alluſions, and analogies. As when we ſay God is juſt, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, good, angry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I cannot be of their mind;<note place="margin">No words full enough to ſee out the nature of God</note> for there are no words or phraſes uſed by or amongſt men, ful enough to ſet out the nature of God. Neither, if there were, are men capable of ſuch makings out of God; for firſt there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween perfections as they are in God, and thoſe that are or may be in created things And therefore ſecondly, one objective con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception cannot be drawne from created and uncreated perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may univocally agree with both; but only analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. And therefore words being images of created things, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uſed but analogically, of an increated and infinite eſſence But to end this particular, and to proceed to ſome other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the life of God. I ſay God is life; and all things in God are life, to wit, that life which is God himſelf. Neither are vital ſubſtance, and vital operation in him diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God hath life compleat, every way compleat, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is wanting to his life. There is no defect. In this Attribute as in others, he is eſſentially what he is, and infinitely, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed incomprehenſibly. Becauſe, Thirdly, he hath life of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſelf, not only the life of operation for that creatures have of themſelves, and living, men do live themſelves, <hi>We live and move &amp;c:</hi> though in God, yet WE <hi>live.</hi> I ſay we have of our ſelves a life of operation both in nature and grace, when the principle of life in either ſtate is once beſtowed, but God hath the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of life in himſelf. <hi>For as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf, Joh:</hi> 5.26. God is what he is of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Neither fourthly, is there any end propounded to God by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> he worketh all things as of himſelf, ſo for himſelf. It is not my ſalvation that God aims at although he ſave me; but his own glory. <hi>He made all things for himſelf, even the wicked to periſh in the day of evil, Prov:</hi> 16.4. A gracious ſoul worketh for God. And God worketh for himſelf in him, not for him. God liveth to himſelf, propoundeth himſelf unto himſelf in all his vital o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, every thing underſtood is life in <hi>God,</hi> things that have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> no life, are life in him. He is a ſuper-vital Eſſence, and a ſuper-eſſential
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168364:18"/> life. He is his own vital operation. The life of <hi>God</hi> is preſent with all Creatures to continue their being; theſe very pillars that bear up this houſe of meeting, although dead in them ſelves, are life in <hi>God;</hi> He is the ſuper-eſſential of exiſtences, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of all. From his wiſedom which is his life by attribution, flows love, which alſo is his life, and by theſe two Attributes are al other things made and formed; in his wiſdom all things live. So ſome read that place in <hi>John</hi> 1.3. the latter part,<note place="margin">Quod factum eſt in ipſo vita erat:</note> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 4th: <hi>That which was made was life in him.</hi> All things have in themſelves a <hi>quoddam eſſe</hi> intrinſecal to themſelves: but this in things created hath a beginning, and is mutable; neither doth it give life to exiſtences that live not. But beſides this <hi>eſſe</hi> which they obtain in themſelves, they have in the mind and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>God</hi> a certain extrinſecal <hi>eſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sapientia Dei eſt omnium intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibilium eſſe, &amp; vita, &amp; lux, Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius de perfec: Div: page <hi>51<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> as it were infuſed, everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and immutable. For to underſtand in <hi>God,</hi> is a certain <hi>eſſe</hi> of intelligibles, by which as in a certain breathing world they do exiſt, ſhine, and live. <hi>I</hi> might tel you many things which are as true as glorious of this life of <hi>God.</hi> But this is not for every hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to underſtand. And it is uſual for people to ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand not.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, the life of <hi>God</hi> doth infinitely tranſcend the life of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Creatures even of Men and Angels; becauſe by his nature he is infinitely more excellent, as I wil make appear unto you in two particulars. Firſt if al living things, Angels, men, Beaſts, fowls, fiſhes, and every other creature that hath life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all thoſe lives that ſince <hi>Adam</hi> have been in all theſe kinds of creatures were brought together, and put into one life; yet this life compared with the life of God, would be but as a picture or image of a man is in compariſon of a man. Secondly, if al Creatures that are in the world, or ever were, could exiſt together; if God ſhould but draw back the beam of his influence, preſently they would vaniſh to nothing, neither would any footſtep of them remaine. For in God it is that we live, moove, and have our being, and there is not the leſt worm in the earth that liveth, but there is an influence that goeth out from <hi>God</hi> to continue it's life: Yea, all exiſtences have their continuance from this Life of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:168364:18"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> To conclude, what life is in God is beſt to be known by negation, and ablation of all that can be ſaid of Life in the Creature. As for inſtance, if yee ſhould ask of me how God doth live; I ſhould thus anſwer, he doth not live like plants, or ſenſitive Creatures; he doth not live like Men, or Angels: but he liveth a Life far tranſcending all Creature-life. I am not able to ſhew you better how God doth live, then by teaching you how God doth not live. As when I ſay God is a living God, I mean, he liveth and moveth of himſelf from an inward principle of life, and ſo you take my meaning. And when I ſay God is good, yee preſently run to the definition of goodneſs touching the Creature. But yet theſe words are too ſhort to ſet out either the Attribute of life, or of goodneſs. When I ſay God is great, as <hi>Pſal:</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5.3. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>great is the Lord, and greatly to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> This word great wil ſet forth the greatneſs of a man, or of any other thing that hath dimenſions: But yet this word great is not great enough to ſet forth the nature of God. There are four (as it were) parts of greatneſs, latitude, longitude, ſublimity, and profundity, which are attributed to God, and in their manner may be conſidered in <hi>God.</hi> Although by the ordinary rules in the Mathematicks we make but three dimenſions, to wit, making ſublimity and profundity one in that one word altitude. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Epheſ:</hi> 3.18. guided by the ſpirit of <hi>God,</hi> ſpeaking of the fulnes of <hi>God,</hi> maketh foure dimenſions (as it were) ſo many parts of the grreatnes of God. I ſay, I wil a little conſider how far theſe words relating to the word great, wil ſet out as part thereof the greatnes of God, or the nature of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of greatneſs. Once <hi>David</hi> ſaith God is great, and he praiſeth God for or in conſideration of his greatnes. What then may be this greatnes of God? I anſwer; Firſt the eſſence of God is great, in regard of latitude, for he is immenſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is great in regard of longitude, for he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly: He is great in regard of ſublimity, for he is moſt high.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly: He is great in regard of profundity, for he is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible.</p>
            <p>Or if we take the word great (as ſometimes it is uſed) for one of great power, dominion, and authority, here alſo we have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168364:19"/> ſome help from the four dimenſions of the <hi>Apoſtle Paul,</hi> to under ſtand ſomething of God, the Lord is great in regard of latitude for all things ſerve him from the higheſt Angel, to the leaſt, and loweſt worm. He is great in regard of Longitude, for of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there is an eternal duration. He is great in regard of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity, for he Reigneth with the higheſt, and moſt abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Alſo he is great in regard of profundity, becauſe he ruleth not only bodies, but hearts, and ordereth the moſt inward thoughts and affections of <hi>all:</hi> neither is there any thing ſo hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or ſecret, which the rod of his Kingdom, and greatneſs doth not penetrate. We may then underſtand ſomewhat by this word GREAT of God: but muſt ſtop our mouths with the cloſe of the Verſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.3. <hi>His greatneſs is unſearchable;</hi> or, of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is no ſearch.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> The Hebrew word doth properly ſignifie finding out, or ſearching after. The <hi>Septuagint,</hi> there is no end of his greatneſs, and ſo the <hi>vulgar</hi> latine: For therefore is no finding out of the greatneſs of God; becauſe the end thereof, neither is nor can be found; for in deed it is not, there is no end of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And therefore in all predications wherein GOD is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, we muſt know that their force is in negation, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. As when we ſay God is a Spirit, we mean he is not a body, when we ſay he is a ſpiritual ſubſtance, we mean he is not a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal ſubſtance. When we ſay he is he is a ſubſtance, we mean he is not an accident. For properly a ſubſtance God, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of that Lative word; for a ſubſtance is that that doth ſtand under accidents, and bear them up, which aſſerted of the eſſence of God is blaſphemy. Yet is that word ſubſtance often attributed to God, but by it we mean eſſence according to the greek word <hi>Ouſia,</hi>

            <p>The ſpirit of a man is lively, outward things are dead things, they cannot touch the ſoul, they are not fitted to the ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof. When all our hopes be dead touching the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting creature, they are alive in the <hi>living God.</hi> Even ſtones are life in God though they live not, their exiſtences are in Gods Life, and by influence from it.

            <p>And Secondly, ſuch as are ready to deſtroy life, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of themſelves, and others, and that either in regard of their outward or inward eſtate.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they which neglect to ſave Life, that make no account of that which is ſo pretious, in which ſo much of God appears. A
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168364:21"/> living Dogg (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) is better then a dead Lyon. And there is more (I ſay) to be ſeen of <hi>God</hi> in one blade of living graſſe, then in the moſt pretious Jewel in the world.

I will ſhew you who they be that are negligent of the preſervation of life, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt of their own lives.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of the lives of others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of their own, ſuch as are not careful to ſhun danger tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the hurt of life, as to be careleſs of the preſervation of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health.<note n="1" place="margin">Careleſſe to avoid dangers:</note> 2 To live like lazy drones idly in time of health, and proſperity; and not to provide for times of ſicknes, and adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.<note n="2" place="margin">Idleneſs and lezineſs:</note> And therefore in the juſt Judgment of <hi>God,</hi> ſuch do often feel the ſmart of it, <hi>Prov:</hi> 6. <hi>ver:</hi> 9.10. There is a deſcription of them. <hi>How long wilt thou ſleep O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleep? yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep.</hi> And then yee have this puniſhment, ver: 11. <hi>So ſhall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man;</hi> and ſo want is his portion, <hi>Prov:</hi> 13.4. <hi>The ſoul of the ſluggard defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and hath nothing.</hi> And beſides the bitterneſs of poverty, there is often bitterneſs upon the ſpirit; even checks, and gripes, and groanings of Conſcience, and a late and unſeaſonable repenting of their careleſneſs, and idleneſs, which is a kind of a Hel unto them.</p>
            <p>Such alſo as bereave themſelves of the comforts of this life; out of a wil to be rich,<note n="3" place="margin">Covetouſnes</note> they wil even ſtarve themſelves, and go a cold, and honour not life which <hi>God</hi> hath communicated to them; ſuch often pierce themſelves through with many ſorrows, and deny themſelves neceſſaries; ſuch wretches prepare a Hel for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beſides Tophet which is prepared of old. They are alwayes either carking how to get, or fearing leſt they ſhould looſe, or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and mourning when they have loſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuch abuſe Life as are negligent of the lives of others; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the poor may want bread, pine away with hunger, men regard it not. But for neglect of the life of the ſoul, who can be ignorant of the abuſe of this precious Jewel Life, in regard both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others. Who can expreſſe the careleſneſs of Men and Women for their poor ſouls. O the neglect of the means of grace yea the contemning, and deſpiſing, and oppoſing the goſpel:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:168364:21"/> which is a ready way to bring a famine upon the place; Such a famine as <hi>Amos.</hi> 8.11. ſpeakes of, <hi>not of bread but of the Word of God:</hi> Which is the greateſt and ſoreſt of all famines,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.11.</note> tending to the deſtruction of the ſoule, the life of which is in comparably to be preferred before the life of the body. Yet wicked people by their neglect, at leaſt, of the good meanes of grace, if not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen oppoſing them, do deprive themſelves and others of the food of their ſouls; By provoking the Lord to take away their Spirituall meat from them. When <hi>Eliah</hi> was taken up into Heaven, <hi>Eliſha cried, my Father, my Father, the charet of Iſrael and horſemen thereof,</hi> 2 Kings. 2.12. But men are of another mind now, they think it no loſſe to be rid of the meanes of grace, and the Miniſters of Chriſt. And no marvell men care not for the lives of the ſouls of others, they have no care of their own. O conſider this ye Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Husbands and Wives, Parents, Children, life is an attribute of God, the life of the ſoul is incomparably more pretious, then of the body. Therfore be not negligent either for your ſelves, or others of the meanes appointed of God, for the ſaving of poore ſoules, that are in danger to be deſtroyed in hell. So much for the firſt head in in this reproofe. Such as neglect to ſave life in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, either the life of the body or of the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And they fall more under this reproof and under <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the ſad effects, the wo pronounced; as are ready to deſtroy life, both their own and others, both in regard of ſoule and body, outward and inward eſtate: as may appear many Do, by what followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as violently ruſh upon dangers that they might avoid,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the deſtruction of their owne life, we read of Chriſt that when <hi>the Jews took up ſtones to caſt at him: he hid himſelfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.59. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>and went out of the temple,</hi> &amp;c. John. 8.59. And when as <hi>Nazareth</hi> they brought him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might caſt him down headlong, he paſſing through the mideſt of them went his way. They abuſe life ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which run upon dangers wilfully and raſhly.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Such alſo abuſe life this jewell, as by imoderat eating and drinking and ſurffetting do ſhorten their daies. As ſome have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168364:22"/> dyed in their Cups, a fearfull ſigne and brand of Gods wrath and diſpleaſure againſt their ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Such as by intemperate courſes and ſatisfying libidinous deſires,<note place="margin">Capell.</note> waſt their radical moyſture, and thereby ſhorten life. It is noted by ſome that <hi>David</hi> was bed rid in or about the age that his Father begat him. This is a giving of our years to the cruel and our honour unto others. And it conſumeth the fleſh and the body:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.9, 10, 11.</note> Firſt, the giving of a mans honour to another. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, their years unto the cruell. Thirdly, their wealth to ſtrangers. Fourthly, the bringing of ſorrow, and mourning upon themſelves at laſt. And laſtly, the conſumption of the fleſh and body of ſuch intemperate ones: <hi>And thou mourn at laſt, when thy fleſh and thy body are conſumed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, When men give themſelves to ungodly courſes whereby they bring themſelves into the hand of the Magiſtrate, and are cut off by his ſword: as many (ye know) come to hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their wickedneſſe. And ſuch ſhall at laſt be araigned for Murther, becauſe they did that which did tend to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their own lives.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Such wicked men abuſe life, <hi>as travaile with pain all their dayes, Job</hi> 15.20. To wit, men of an unquiet and reſtleſſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: The Originall word for a wicked man, ſignifieth an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet motion; unquiet is his name, and unquietneſſe is his, both practiſe and portion: alwayes are ſome raiſing ſtirs, and acting Tragedies. He travelleth with pain, he is in pain as a woman in travell: and whereas women that have hardeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, are but in travell many dayes; ſome wicked men are in travell all their dayes; painfull throws daily; to bring forth miſchief, which cauſeth death. O what an abuſe of life is this! Cannot men be contented to go to eternal pain in Hell; but they muſt keep killing of themſelves all the day long before they come there? Such have wo, ſorrow, contentions, babling, wounds without cauſe, black and blew eyes: A contentious man never wants wo.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, this is an abuſe for life, when men from a curſed principle of Idolatry or Superſtition ſhall abuſe their bodies, and macerate their fleſh: As the children of Iſrael ſacrificed their children to <hi>Moloch</hi> in the Valey of <hi>Benhinnom:</hi> and as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:168364:22"/> Papiſts whip and laſh themſelves, like fools as they are; to whom God will ſay, who required this at your hands? We read of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, that they cut themſelves with Knives, and Lancers, till the bloodguſhed out upon them, <hi>c.</hi> 18.18. This is the effect of erronious ſeduced Conſciences. We have read ſtrange ſtories of Eremites and Anchorites: Of one I have read, that choſe rather to be burnt than to ſave his life, out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his Religion: As in the <hi>Weſt-Indians,</hi> they will rather ſacrifice their Children to their <hi>Hoggery Abamacho</hi> (the Devill indeed) rather then ſeem to be irreligious. O what ſorrows have men brought on themſelves and miſeries; yea murthers upon others from erronious Conſciences! Hence ſuch woful doings of late in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> no conſideration being had of the worth of life.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Wicked men abuſe life, by their own active malice. And that diverſe wayes: Firſt, by entrapping themſelves in thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſnares, which they prepared for others. As <hi>Haman</hi> built a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and was hanged upon it himſelf, <hi>Heſt</hi> 7.10. Many out of malice dig pits for others, and fall into them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Notable for this Writes the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 7.15, 16. <hi>He made a pit and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made: His miſchief ſhall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing ſhall come down upon his own pate.</hi> So that many times none are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemies to any others, whom they moſt malice, then ſuch malicious perſons are to their own ſelves. Secondly, when mens malice makes them to weary, and tyre out themſelves to do miſchief: we read of ſome, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5. That did weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to commit iniquity; and we know many that do even ſpend themſelves out to nothing, to wreack their malice upon others: eſpecially, upon ſuch as are godly, and Religious. Wicked men are often cruell in over burdening themſelves. The way of malice is often found to be a weariſome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying way to the actors themſelves: The Author of that Hiſtory, <hi>The travels of the old Patriarchs, Kings and Prophets;</hi> when he comes to write the motions of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who was a great King, but of a moſt malicious ſpirit againſt the people of God. He obſerves that in purſuance of his bloody deſigns, he had run more hazzards, and taken more tedious journeys to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168364:23"/> ſatisfie his malice and reach his ambitious ends, then any of the Saints had done upon any command or ſervice of God: Upon which conſideration, he makes this excellent concluſion; <hi>That wicked men take more pains to go to Hell and eternall deſtruction, then godly men do in the way to eternal life and ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 8. Wicked men abuſe their life by their over earneſtneſſe to avoid thoſe troubles, which they meet withall in their life; their earneſtneſſe to avoid trouble, tumbles them into it. A godly man is deſcribed <hi>eating the labour of his hands,</hi> Pſal. 128.2. That is, the very work which he doth feeds him: and before he hath any reward for his work, he findes a reward in his work. On the other ſide, the labour of a wicked man eats him: The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his hand, and the labour of his head, eat him out, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.13. <hi>Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counſels.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks there of the endeavour of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> to be rid of thoſe evils, which are threatned to come upon them: and in <hi>chapter</hi> 57.10. of the ſame propheſie, the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>wearied in the greatneſſe of their way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 9. Upon their diſappointment of their hopes, wicked men do (as it were) kill themſelves with grief, when they cannot attain their end: as they do kill themſelves with labour and ſinfull care to attain their end. They uſe to hang between hope and fear, while they are at work: but when they ſee they tumble, and cannot come at what they would have, they fall into the Gulf of deſpaire and anguiſh of ſpirit: And alſo ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Gods judgment are afflicted with a fiercer pain then either of theſe, even with the gripes and gnawings of an evill conſcience, for the evill they have done. This death ſhall be their portion after death, and follow ſome wicked men all the dayes of their life. <hi>A dreadfull ſound is in his ears: Job</hi> 15.21. And ſometimes (with <hi>Cain</hi>) they think every one that meeteth them will kill them; <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. And ſo God ſets <hi>Cain's</hi> mark upon them, fear of heart and trembling of body. A fearfull heart and a ſhaking body, is often the portion of men that live in ſin.<note place="margin">Timor cordis et tremor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris. <hi>Pareus.</hi>
               </note> If ye compare the 2. of <hi>Habacuck</hi> 10, 11, 12. with <hi>Job</hi> 15. ye ſhall ſee this for ſubſtance, that when men live in ſin, they provoke God either to take away their lives, or to make their lives miſerable. Sometimes God taketh away that which they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168364:23"/> have ill gotten, and driveth them to <hi>dwell in deſolate cities, and houſes which no man inhabiteth;</hi> which are ready to become heaps, curſing the ſtones of the wall, and the timber of their houſes. And if they do leave any thing, when they wretchedly dy, they leave it with the appurtenances (as one wittily ſaid) to wit, the curſe of God to have and to hold to their heirs, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after them.</p>
            <p>And as wicked men abuſe this Jewel of great worth, life in themſelves, in their readineſſe to deſtroy it, or make it miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in regard of their bodies and temporall enjoyments: ſo alſo in regard of their poor ſouls: They live ſo wickedly, ſo prophanely, ſo diſobediently to God and his Word, that they provoke God to take away the means of grace from them, or to give them up to a mind paſt feeling, and to bring upon them a famine of the Word, the greateſt of all judgment, except a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſpirit, and mind void of judgment under the Word.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly they fall under this reproof and wo, that abuſe the life of others by oppreſſion, when they throw down the right of others and thruſt them out of doores to ſet their own neſt on high, their Tabernacles are Tabernacles of bribery, <hi>Job.</hi> 15.34. and their houſes are full of blood, which the earth ſhall not cover,<note place="margin">Et vae, vae, vae, illis qui cauſa ſunt quod ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae ſine miniſtris et verbo relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> but it ſhall ly as a record upon the file to be brought forth againſt them at the laſt day.

               </note>Fourthly, We are now come to a Uſe of exhortation, that we be all carefull of life, of our own life, and of the life one of another, of bodily life, and of the life of the ſoule, for ſuch a life, and death too there is, as may be gathered out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>And fear not them which kill the body, and are not able to kill the ſoule: but rather fear him which is able to deſtroy both body and ſoule in hell:</hi> ye ſee mention there of killing and deſtroying the ſoule as well as the body: Now in the proſecution of this uſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation I ſhall lay before you ſome motives and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As firſt, Gods example, who hath Provided many good things for the preſervation of life; as Food, Raiment, Phyſick; and ſhall we be careleſſe of that which God hath been ſo careful about? This cannot but be conſtrued high contempt of this je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of Life. But now let us be like God, who hath ſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the preſervation of life; ſo let us for the lives of our ſelves and others. And for the life of the ſoul, what a deal of pains and trouble hath God and his Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> been at, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it from Hell and Death? God about this, ſent his only Son into the World, to dy a moſt ſhamefull and painfull death. He hath ſuffered many of his choice and eminent ſervants to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure exquiſite torments, that ſouls might be ſaved from death. And therefore let this prevaile, let us be herein like unto God; do all that we can to preſerve life, and to ſave ſouls. Let us be rich in good works of this nature; that is, in ſaving life, and give comfort to thoſe that have none. For otherwiſe we ſhall not ſhew our ſelves to be like to God. And the cry of the dying will enter into his eares.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:168364:24"/>
            <p>Secondly, conſider the neceſſity of this work of ſaving life.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The body without life ſtinketh, now God may have glory by its living. The dead go downe to the pit of ſilence. The grave cannot praiſe thee (ſaith <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) death cannot celebrate thee. They that go downe into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he ſhall praiſe thee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.18.19. If we do not what we can to preſerve life, we do (as it were) bereave God of that honour which he might have in our life, and in the lives of others. We have a proverb, make much of your ſelves, good folks be ſcarce. This hath ſome place here, if it could be thought and ſpoken with holy gravity and ſeriouſnes and in the fear of the Lord. Ye that fear God, make much of your ſelves and one another, do what ye can to preſerve life, and to make your own and each others life comfortable; that God may have the more glory by you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider the excellency of this vouchſafement of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> life: Shall a Prince give me a Diamond, and ſhall I caſt it into the dirt? Why the God of heaven hath given me the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of himſelfe at leaſt analogically; <hi>viz.</hi> life. And ſeing I have ſuch a jewell I ſhould be carefull to preſerve it. Not as an Epicure or Atheiſt that would fain live, becauſe he knoweth no other happineſſe but this life; but that I may glorifie God, who is worthy of all, and much more, then men or Angels can ſay of him, or do, to the ſetting forth of his praiſe and honour. And thus much concerning the firſt Proportion or Doctrine,<note place="margin">Of life commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> that life is an attribute of God.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a communicable one, to mankinde and other creatures. So we read Gen. 2.7. <hi>And the Lord God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life; and man became a living ſoul.</hi> And Act. 17.25. <hi>Seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things:</hi> and verſ. 23. <hi>For in him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> And a moſt tranſcendent life, in compariſon of the life of Plants and Beaſts, hath God imparted to mankinde: a reaſonable ſoule full of excellencies. Yea, ſo liberall hath God been in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of this gift, as that even inferiour creatures have their portion; though in an inferiour degree to mankinde: Unto whom God hath vouchſafed a greater dignity in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168364:25"/> then to any of his corporeall creatures elſe. In that he was created after the image of God, to have rule and authority over the other creatures Gen. 1.26. <hi>And God ſaid, let us make man in our image,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pronaque cum ſpectent ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malia caetera terra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> os homini ſublime dedit, caelumque vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere juſſit, et erectos ad ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera tollere vulius Ovid. Meta.</note>

            <p>Now therefore mankinde that hath received ſuch a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit at the hand of God herein, ought to be thankfull to God for this gift of life: and carefully and conſcionably to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live to the glory of God the giver of it: But O the wonderfull ingratitude, and unthankfulneſſe of mankinde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God for this favour of his; the multitude of men do quite contrary, give up themſelves to live altogether to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour, ſmite him on the face with his owne benefit, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all manner of ſin and ungodlineſſe; whereby they make themſelves <hi>ſtrangers from the life of God,</hi> perverting and altering their creation in reſpect of the end thereof: <hi>For whereas</hi> God <hi>created men for his glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde is rebellious, and in the way of diſobedience againſt his Creatour; for which rebellion of his, he muſt be ſure to ſmart: for the moſt gracious God will not by any meanes <hi>clear the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> but in his juſtice will ſurely reward them to their face ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their wickedneſſe, and although he may deferre his judgements for a time,<note place="margin">

If God feeds the Ravens, and cloaths the Lillies, will he not feed and cloath his faithfull ſervants? Yes undoubtedly, for he hath promiſed not to fail, or forſake them; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6. <hi>For he hath ſaid I will not leave thee, nor forſake thee: ſo that we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man ſhall do unto me: They ſhall want nothing that is good for them, for there is no want to them that fear him, the young Lyons want and ſuffer hunger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.

It was the reſolute faithfull ſpeech of one <hi>Elizabeth Yong,</hi> a Confeſſour mentioned by <hi>Mr. Foxe</hi> in his Book of Acts and Monuments in the latter end of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> When they threatned to ſtarve her, quoth ſhe, If ye take away my meat the Lord will take away mine hunger. <hi>O Taſt and ſee that the Lord is gratious: Bleſſed is the man that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him</hi> Pſal. 34.8.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Molives to live to Gods glory.</note> and to walk thankfully towards God in the uſe of it, by a carefull endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live to the glory of God. Let us, every one of us dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently labour to performe this duty. For firſt, it is a juſt thing in reſpect of God, it is meete that God that hath given us life,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſhould be honoured in, and with our lives. Let us not live to eat, and drink, and ly downe, and riſe up to play, to pleaſe our voluptuouſneſſe; or to work to pleaſe our luſt of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: but let us glorifie God in our lives, fith he hath given them to us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is a neceſſary thing in reſpect of our ſelves, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if we live not to Gods honour, but walk on in the way of ſinne
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168364:26"/> we ſhall live to our one ſhame and eternall deſtruction moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a profitable thing both in reſpect of our ſelves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and others. For by living to Gods glory, we ſhall gaine to our ſelves glory, and be matter of good example worthy the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others: And this is praiſe worthy to give good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. It is commanded <hi>Math.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men that they may ſee your good workes and glorifie your father which is in heaven.</hi> And 1 Pet. 2.12. <hi>Having your converſation honeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles that where as they ſpeak againſt you as evill doers they may by your good works which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of viſitation.</hi> And as it is profitable to others, ſo alſo to our ſelves abundantly. For as ye ſow, ſo ſhall ye reap, if yee ſow to righteouſnes, your name ſhall be ſpoken of with honour when ye are dead and gone. The righteous ſhall be honorable both in their lives and in their death. And therefore while we live let us live to the glory of God, that ſo it may befall us, that we may have honour in life, a ſweet name after death, and that we may be good examples to them amongſt whom we live, that they alſo may glorifie God, when God ſhall viſit their ſoules in mercy. Then will they (with <hi>David</hi>) bleſſe the Lord that gave us a life, and bleſſe us, and our good examples: as he did the Lord that ſent her,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam</hi> 25.</note> and her, and her good councell.</p>

            <p>Firſt, He that would live to Gods glory muſt ſhun all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of ſin and ſinfull wayes: he muſt forſake thoſe contrary courſes that tend to Gods diſhonour: you muſt know what God can not abide, and lay that aſide. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.13. <hi>The fear of the Lord is to hate evill, pride and arrogancy: and the evill way, and the froward mouth do I hate, ſaith wiſedome there.</hi> Now, would you glorify God, then hate evill, lay aſide your pride, and let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: and ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.16. <hi>A wiſeman feareth, and departeth from evill:</hi> evill courſes muſt be forſaken, yea evill men that worke wickedneſſe: for both read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.4. <hi>Incline not my heart</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>to any evill thing to practice wicked workes, with men that worke iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties:</hi> both evill workes, and evill workers muſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168364:26"/> be ſhunned, by ſuch as would live to the glory, and honour of the Author of their life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such muſt carefully ſet, and ſettle themſelves to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the workes of holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, every one in his owne particular perſon; dilligently endeavouring to walke holily, and uprightly towards God and the world. <hi>That ye may be blamleſſe, and harmleſſe, the ſons of God, without rebuke, in the middeſt of a crooked, and perverſe nation, among whom ye ſhine as lights in the world,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle Paul. <hi>Phillip.</hi> 2.15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We muſt labour all that we can, ſo much as lyeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in our power, to provoke others to the wayes, and workes of godlineſſe; eſpecially thoſe that are any wayes allyed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to us, either in regard of kindred, or acquaintance, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch like reſpect: as in the verſe following my text, <hi>viz.

If people inſtead of provoking God by their ſinnes; and provoking one another to wrath by ſpeaking and doing ſuch things as they know they cannot beare; Would ſtudy this commendable kind of provocation; we ſhould have a ſweet time of it.

A deaf, a dumbe idole, a thing without life, as a ſenceleſs creature that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not the ways and works of men, who imagine God to be ſo confin'd to one place in reſpect of the powers of life, as that he ſees not, nor knows not what is done afar off, <hi>Job</hi> 22.13.14. <q>And thou ſaiſt, how doth God know?

            <p>Secondly. Seeing the life of God is infinite &amp;c. it teacheth <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> us that God can give life and that in abundance both temporal and eternal. And therefore though God take away the lives of his people and they dy with men, yet they ſhall live for ever with God. And this <hi>Job</hi> comforteth himſelf with,<note place="margin">

The people of God that now ly in the grave are alive in God and Chriſt. All are alive in God that are dead and ſhall be brought forth of their graves, like toades out of their holls. But the Saints ſhall be brought forth by Chriſt as their head to live with him in glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let Chriſtians ſtand and admire the excellencie of <label type="milestone">

If we can be cared for ſo long as Gods life ſhall laſt, we need not care for any thing afterward. I ſpeak it with holy diſdain to all them that know not the life of God. Tis true, the life of a Chriſtian is a life of trouble: at beſt a mixture of evill with good. But Gods life is infinite and eternal. Hence it is, that the loving kindneſs of the Lord is ſaid to be better then life; becauſe when life departs, we live for ever in the living God.

Although this acceptation alſo of the word good, be to be ſpoken of, when I ſhall have finiſhed this, <hi>viz. The Morall Goodneſſe of God,</hi> or his holineſs or chaſtity (as ſome ſtile it.) But beſides theſe two acceptations of the word <hi>good</hi> or <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> viz. <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>morall;</hi> there is a third, which is <hi>uſefull goodneſſe,</hi> as the Greek word uſed for it doth ſignifie.

There is yet a fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Word is taken for Mercy or ſweet compaſſion, which alſo in regard of God, is to be referred to the attribute of <hi>Mercy.</hi> For the preſent my work is to ſpeak of the application of this word <hi>good</hi> or <hi>goodneſs</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> according to the firſt acceptation, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is taken for natural goodneſſe: which ſome call the perfection of God to diſtinguiſh it from moral goodneſs, which is ſometimes alſo called perfection, though uſefull goodneſſe or benignity never hath that name put upon it, nor mercy neither. Yet all foure have paſſed under this general word <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> as were eaſie to ſhew if it were to any great purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The words which I have choſen to make my Text, do ſeem to me to ſpeak of this natural goodnes or perfection of God.

            <p>The words are an anſwer unto a demand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> propoſed as may be ſeen, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>And he ſaid, I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory.</hi> A requeſt ſomewhat like unto that motion which <hi>Peter</hi> made, Mat. 17.4. <hi>Then anſwered Peter and ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord is it good for us to be here, if thou wilt, let us make here three Tabernacles, one for thee,</hi>

Now to demonſtate this natural goodnes or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God, (who is ſo good that he cannot be better) I will, fetch an argument from the gradations of things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perfection in this manner. There is in the nature of things ſomthing which is beſt, moſt true, moſt noble, the prime being, and which is the cauſe unto all other things of that goodnes that they have. There are entities more or leſſe noble
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168364:30"/> (as we have continual experience) Now more and leſſe are ſaid of things diverſe, as they come neerer, or are more remote from that which is the rule and eſpecially and perfectly ſuch. And this is God, the firſt efficient cauſe of all created perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">

               </note> which are more or leſs excellent as they come neereſt or are moſt diſtant from the goodneſs or perfection of God If all the goodnes natural that is wrapt up in the eſſence of all creatures, Angels, men, beaſts, Fiſhes, Fowls, and what ever elſe hath a place in the creation, were gathered into one goodneſſe or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, God would infinitely tranſcend it. And the reaſon is becauſe they have all they have from God. God is the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fountain of all the goodneſſe in the world, all Candles are lighted at his Candle: and by what any thing is ſuch as it is, that muſt much more be ſuch: likewiſe the perfection of God muſt be moſt compleat, becauſe he is the <hi>ipſum eſſe</hi> of himſelf. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beings hang upon the being of God, and did he not uphold them, they would fall to nothing preſently. But as for God, he is of himſelf, <hi>before the mountains were brought forth,</hi> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 90.2. <hi>Or ever thou hadſt formed the earth and the world: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from everlaſting to everlaſting, thou thou art God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former argument was ſtrong. For ſith God doth moſt perfectly act he muſt needs be moſt perfect and good in all his actings, and therefore a moſt perfect entity or being. But this ſecond reaſon is more convincing. He is God of himſelfe, and not by the procurement of any other. Many other things, even to the dazling of the eys of your underſtanding, might I ſay of this goodnes of Gods nature, and being: But that I am loath to puzzle you with darke things, and notions, leſt the words ſpoken by the Lord to <hi>Job,</hi> cap. 38.2 ſhould be applied unto me. <hi>Who is this that darkneth Counſell by words without knowledge?</hi>

            <p>Firſt the ſubſtance of each creature hath its goodnes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, be on this good being of God and in this regard, ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> (whoſe waies I will uſe, leaſt I ſhould be accounted a blaſphemer, as out of ignorance and malice I have often been for no more cauſe) Every creature is good, partly by creation, and partly by ordination.<note place="margin">Perkins in his Preface to his caſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> By creation, it is that the ſubſtance of each creature, as of the Sun, the Moon, the Earth, Water, Meat, Drink, &amp;c. is good. Having the being thereof from God. Hence alſo, the eſſentiall properties, <hi>quantites, qualities, actions,</hi> and inclinations of the creatures, in themſelves conſidered, withall their events are good. Things again do take unto them the condition of goodnes, not only by creation, but alſo by Gods ordination, whereby they are directed and appointed to ſome certaine uſes and ends. Thus the evill conſcience, hell and death are good, becauſe they are ordained of God, for the execution of his juſtice, howſoever in themſelves and to us they be evill.</p>
            <p>And it muſt needs be ſo; Becauſe (as we began this uſe) God is the author of all things &amp; actions, and his nature is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly and perfectly good. All things that come to paſſe in the world are the fruit of that goodnes that is eſſentially in God. I meane as they are naturall actions, for I ſpeak not now of the moralitie of them. And therefore that doctrine of generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption (as it muſt forſooth be called) ſo much cryed up of late by ſome apoſtates and ſelf conceited men; Doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelfe to be a meer ſottiſh opinion, And very much below the <hi>heart</hi> and judgment of a man that is a ſound Chriſtian, or indeed learned. For my part I cannot poſſible ſee God to be an infinite perfect, and firſt-cauſe, if this doctrine be true and ſound. I have been almoſt thirty years enquiring for one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I cannot Anſwer; and have not yet met with it. But ſome may ſay this is ſtrange doctrine, that all things and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be good: What is the devill good too? we are ſure he is called that evill one or wicked one.<note place="margin">Peccatum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, Et artis In peccato nihil poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum.</note> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3.12. To which I Anſwer, that God did not create the Devil as he is conſidered a Devil, but an Angel. The ſoundeſt and moſt judicious, both Theologicians and Metaphyſicians do hold that ſinne is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and hath in it nothing poſitive.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:168364:31"/>
            <p>If ye be acquainted with the nature of the word <hi>Peccatum,</hi> ſinne, as it is to be found in nature and in art, ye will eaſily be ſatisfied in this thing It is in both when they do not attain that end for which either of them doth operate. As in nature, which never intendeth a monſter, yet ſometimes ſuch a birth comes: And in arts both liberall and mechanicall; Often times faults and ſinnes do happen. And a Phyſician doth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kill when he ſhould and would cure. And a Carpenter ſomtimes ſpoyles his timber in hewing or cutting it, which is a fault. And ſo it is concerning the <hi>peccatum</hi>'s committed dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt God's law. There is a defect, a ſwerving from the rule. (Sin as the <hi>Apoſtle, John</hi> ſaith. 1 <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> 3.4) is an anomie, that is a want of confirmitie to the law of God. I have ſhewed you before now, of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, that three things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it, and in him firſt: <hi>Viz.</hi> the ſubſtance of his body and ſoule, the faculties and powers of his body and ſoule, and the image of God conſiſting in a conformity of the affections and powers to Gods will. So that as in Muſick when the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are out of tune, there is diſcord, which is the want or abſcence of harmony, which we may call diſharmony. So is it ni the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> there is only the want of conformitie in the powers of the ſoule. There is preſent ſubſtance and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſoule and body: But one queſtion more. Is there not ſin beſides the want of conformitie in the powers of the ſoule to the law of God, ſomething elſe <hi>viz.</hi> an habite or preſence of evill? I Anſwer. If ſin be conſidered by it ſelfe in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Sinne is not an inclination or action, but a want. But if we conſider it with its ſubjects, it is an evill inclination or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As it is an action to take away a mans life, to wit to move the body to lift up the weapon, &amp;c. So it is no ſinne properly for then the executioner that takes a way the life of a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour ſhould ſinne in ſo doing. It is therefore the diſorder and aberration in the action that maketh it a ſinne. The nature of the ſinne then lies not in the action but in the manner of doing the action, and ſinne properly is nothing formally ſubſiſting, but its a want of that which ought to be or ſubſiſt, partly in the nature of man &amp; partly in the actions of nature. So that ſtill it remaineth a moſt certaine truth, that God is the creatour and ordainer of every thing and action whether it be good or evill.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:168364:32"/> It is true luſt doth draw the heart away from the ſervice of God. And <hi>James</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt and intiſed,</hi> and to intiſe or draw away is an action that cannot proceed from a meere privation. But this is ſtill by reaſon of the ſubject in which this defect is. But I ſupoſe I have ſaid enough to give ſatisfaction about this thing. And to return, to cloſe up my uſe, That of things and actions, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and ſupernaturall, God is the author and Orderer.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> And Secondly Saith, God is ſo good and perfect, becauſe he could not elſe be God if he were not ſo. Let this be treaſured up as the firſt truth of all, God is perfect, there is no defect in him. If this were not, nothing ſhould be. As if the heavenly bodies do not move, there is no motion heere below; So if God had not a perfect being, nothing could ever have been at all. And if this oracle this <hi>primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mobile</hi> in a gratious ſoul be wel lodged, admirable effects will follow. As for God his way is perfect, why ſo, becauſe he is perfect, and what then? It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>he is a buckler to all thoſe that truſt in him.</hi> Pſalme 18.30. And then againe. This perfect God will make our way perfect 10 <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>It is God that girdeth me with ſtrength and maketh my way perfect.</hi> He that ſees Gods perfection muſt needes runne to him. <hi>What David prayed for touching Gods law, Open thou mine eies that I may behold the wonderous things of thy law.</hi> Pſalme 119.18. That ſhould we pray for touching God himſelfe. Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the wonderous things of thine eſſence and nature. God ſaith, our is great without quantity, good without quality, Infinite without number, beautifull without ſhape or figure, eternal without time, unmeaſurable or immenſe without multiplicity, moſt high without ſcituation, the center of the Uinverſe to whom all things tend, in whom they quieſce, by whom they are ſuſtained, and (let me adde with whom alone they can be ſatisfied.) In God is allurement of all love, Conſumation of all deſire, termination of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſatiety of all appetite; In God is the all of all.</p>

Such are they, as make not God their portion. God complains of the Jews, that they had committed two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168364:32"/> Thouſands are guilty hereof, even all ſuch as forſake the Lord, the fountain of living waters, and hew out to themſelves ciſterns broken ciſterns that will hold no water: what fools are ſuch as will run to ſpunfuls, when they may enjoy the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that forſake God in whom they may enjoy all things? what would ye have that may make you happy, that is not to be had in God? would ye be ſafe? His name is a ſtrong tower, they that come to him ſhall dwell on high, their ſtrength ſhall be the munition of rocks: would ye walk wiſely? come to him who is wiſdome it ſelf, and ye may be wiſer then your enemies, then your teachers, then the ancient. I might enlarge my ſelf upon ſeverall other particulars: But I had rather help you to draw waters out of this deep Well, and this ſhall be the next Uſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Therefore learn the skill to build handſomly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> this ground, that God is a Fountain, an Ocean, perfection it ſelf: It is a notable piece of skill to profit by this Doctrine. As it is Gods infinite happines to be ſo good, as to need nothing out of himſelf: ſo it will be ours to have skill to extract from this one infinite fulneſſe. The more things a man wants that he cannot be without, the more miſerable he is, and therefore ſuch as to whom thoſe things are neceſſary, which to the Saints are ſuperfluous, are exceeding miſerable. They want all things that want God. All their other candles will ſoon be blown out. Their mountain of ſnow will melt away ſhortly, if they be not dragged away from it before. And therefore, I hope, ye ſee what a buſineſſe of importance it is, to have the skill to bring this perfection, God bleſſed for ever, out of that hidden light, which none can attain unto, and to make uſe of him for our good. Now we know there muſt be a bringing of one thing to another, to make uſefull one thing for another. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick muſt be taken, Plaſters muſt be applied, meat and drink muſt be received into the body, and cloaths muſt be put on; or elſe they will not be effectual to thoſe ends and purpoſes, for which they are ordained. So God and the ſoul muſt be brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the object by the act: we have already heard that God is perfection, good every way. A man can be in no condition wherein God cannot help him: and therefore the foundation is fit and firm for the ſoul to build upon. Now therefore the ſcripture teacheth us by precept and example, that God who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:168364:33"/> is the chiefeſt good muſt be truſted in, and brought home that way, and behold, a preſent ſupply for all defects, a preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for all diſtempers, and a preſent good for all ſorts of men, and every kind of thing. To be men of hope, men of truſt, men of confidence, men of Faith. For now I muſt not care for criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes. There are differences and diſtinctions which ſomtimes have their Uſe. Faith looks to the promiſes, Hope to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promiſed; truſt or confidence is the ſtrength of hope, which being deferred cauſes waiting, waiting is hope and truſt length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out: We have many excellent phraſes to ſet out this acting of the ſoul; I will uſe them promiſcuouſly: As firſt, of ſtaying, ſecondly, of reſting; thirdly, of leaning; fourthly, of waiting; fifthly, of rolling our ſelves upon God: And all theſe forms of words and expreſſions come to one end, to wit, that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perfection of all things is to be truſted and relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And according to the great miſtery of Father, Son, and Spirit; we muſt look upon God in Chriſt, <hi>reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. Thus have we found a midle perſon a Mediatour, to bring perfection and emptines together: For ſupream perfection doth abhor ſuch as we are by ſin, but our nature is made lovely to God in Chriſt: and Gods exactnes and perfection is very dreadfull, he is a conſuming fire; but now it is made lovely to us in Chriſt. Who hath made up the vaſt gulf between God and man. And now remember my Text, <hi>I will make all my goodnes paſſe before thee.</hi> Do but conſider goodnes and perfections in creatures, grace and holines, ſweetnes of affection, power and wiſdome &amp;c. And then abſtract imperfections in your underſtanding, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the beſt of men, conſider that in men there be but beams and ſparkles of goodnes no not in the beſt. But in God, fullnes which is peculiar to him. And to help us to cloſe with him, let us thinke upon his incommunicable attributs, thoſe glorious ſingularities (as one calls them) which cannot be imputed to men. He is infinitely eternally and immutably Good. He is a gratious God, a loving God, a powerfull God, a wiſe God, &amp;c. He is a God, do but conſider that. And laſtly, further to draw us to put on this all, in all, and to cloſe with him; Conſider for your ever laſting comfort that Gods goodnes and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are become fatherly. We muſt looke upon him under that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:168364:33"/> ſweet relation of a father, when we have occaſion to make uſe of him. And both theſe conſiderations are wrapped up excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in that preface or introduction <hi>Math.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Our father which art in heaven.</hi> Remember both, and reſigne up your ſelves to his will, and truſt in him. Thus we ſhould ſtrenghen our faith by this perfection of God made uſefull for us in the hands of a mediatour. It is not enough for me to beleeve the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God's will that whatſoever he pleaſeth that he doth, that the will of God, is the neceſſity of a thing; and ſo to ſee the perfection of his power: but alſo to know that his will is holy, juſt, and good, and that he intendeth my good in all that befalleth me, and that his will is ever more moſt wiſe, guided by counſell, that he is a God of judgment, and therefore to ſay the will of the Lord be done, not only patiently, but faithfully, kiſſing the good rod with which he whips us, truſting him for his skill and not calling at any time his good will to us into queſtion. Alwaies to put our ready <hi>fiat</hi> to Gods <hi>placet,</hi> out of aſſurance that no hurt ſhall befall us, that he can hinder, becauſe he is <hi>our father:</hi> And that he can hinder all things whatſoever, <hi>becauſe he is in heaven.</hi> Thus I have indeavoured to teach you to climbe <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, and to hold faſt as you are going up to your Father in heaven through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt: and ſo much for this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and alſo of this firſt Doctrine. That perfection is an attribute of God, I come to the Second,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this naturall goodneſſe or perfection is a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable attribute. In this ſence at leaſt in part, it is ſaid Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes 7.29. <hi>God hath made man upright,</hi> or perfect, or good.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Prop.</hi> or <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note> It is true in one ſence, <hi>Adam</hi> quickly loſt that goodnes which God gave him in his creation, to witt the conformity of the powers of his ſoule to Gods moſt holy will: but as yet as a creature he continued good, and all other creatures are good as they are creatures. Faln Angels &amp; faln men do keep that eſſential good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which God gave them in the creation. And that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are good it is evident <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. <hi>And God ſaw every thing that he had made: and behold it was very good.</hi> And from the 119. <hi>Pſalme</hi> and the 96. verſe, where <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection:</hi> it muſt needs follow that there are perfections, how elſe could <hi>David</hi> ſee an end of them? We cannot ſee an end of thoſe things that never were. Such things as have an
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:168364:34"/> end muſt of neceſſity firſt have a being. Neither can the place in any caſe be underſtood of Gods perfection, for of that there is neither begining nor end.<note place="margin">

Therefore it muſt be underſtood of created perfection that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaw the end of:<note place="margin">Magnitudinis ſine non eſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> therefore perfection is communicable, given out by God to creatures: ſuch as <hi>David</hi> had ſeene an end of. And although it cannot be true, that <hi>David</hi> had ſeene an end of all perfection with the eies of his body: yet with the eys of his underſtanding,<note place="margin">Caryl on <hi>Job</hi> 5 part page 160.</note> he had ſeen an end (even) of all perfection. Doubtleſs the eys of <hi>Davids</hi> body, had ſeen the end of many hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perfections. But by the ey of his underſtanding, he had ſeen an end of them all. And ſo may every man elſe. For the ſcaffold on which all worldly perfections are ſhewen, muſt fall: &amp; therfore theſe perfections cannot ſtand. All our life is but an acting on a ſtage, and God will be ſeen as perfect and excellent in thoſe that act the vileſt parts, as in thoſe that act the beſt. And though it be not good for <hi>Judas</hi> to be damned; yet it will be good that <hi>Judas</hi> be damned in reſpect of God; for in it, his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice will be manifeſted and declared. So then conſider this, <hi>the faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.29. Therefore we may ſee an end of all thoſe perfections, with the eys of our ſouls; though not with the eys of our bodies. Therefore there are created perfections, and ſo conſequently, perfection is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable attribute of God.</p>

Perfection in a ſtrict ſence, is that to which nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">VVhat perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is?</note> and from which nothing can be taken way: In this ſence, there is no humane perfection nor creature perfection.

Whereas Divine perfections, the end of them cannot be ſeen: when we have ſeen the moſt of them,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168364:34"/> there is more of them unſeen: of Creatures, it is true, they are frail and momentary. But yet the word is uſed to ſignifie all the works of God: which after their kind are all perfect, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added by way of addition to any creature in his kind to make it more perfectly ſuch &amp; ſuch a creature,<note place="margin">

               </note> ſpeak of whatſoever ye will. And indeed the compleat perfection of each creature after his kind, is a ſigne of the divine perfection in the whole kind of being in general. So that, that which God is the author of in all things that have a being is their perfection. And this ſtandeth in two things, firſt, their verity or truth; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their goodneſſe. Their verity, is their conformity to that meaſure, and rule by which they are formed, and their goodnes is their perfect fitneſſe for that end unto which they are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And theſe are the two proprieties of every created perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And every thing is good and true; truly what it ſhould be, as God from all eternity had conceived in his eternal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and good and fit for thoſe ends to which they are made, which although they be manifold, yet is there one utmoſt end of all things, to wit, the glory of God. And by how much more any thing ſerveth to the declaration of the natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; it is truly to be called more excellent and good entitative (as the Schools ſpeak.)</p>
            <p>And now to make ſome Uſe of this Truth: Firſt, we learn <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> that all things in the world are good,,<note place="margin">Omne ens eſt bonum.</note> as they are eſſences and came out of Gods hands: and all actions are good as they are natural actions; but of this I have ſpoken ſufficiently out of the former Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let not any dare to find fault either with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> or providences of God. For who can come after God to mend what he hath done? Let us admire the various creatures God hath made and attribute to them all goodnes; for it is by God communicated to every one. Let us ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 104.24, 25. <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy works! in wiſdom haſt thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide ſea, wherein are all things creeping innumerable: both ſmall and great beaſts.</hi> And for tranſactions in the world, let us know that Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is extended as far as his creation: and that every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in every Element and place whatſoever is good and acteth well; receiving a powerfull influence from God, who preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them in their perfections and beings, and likewiſe in their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:168364:35"/> workings, and governs them to their ends. And ſhould not God do ſo, by a continued kinde of creation; creatures would quickly loſe their entitative perfection, and come to nothing from whence they came. And ſhould not God guide things, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans malice and mans weaknes would ſoon bring all to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But every thing made is kept to its work; even Devils and wicked men, who fulfill Gods will while they ruſh againſt it, and do actions ordained even while they trample ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under foot. Labour rather to ſubmit to this truth of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated perfections to things and actions: Creatures work according to their nature, man freely; others by natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, thoſe things are of God: he maintaineth the power and manner of working; he ſtirs up our abilities and actions as he pleaſeth: He ſuſpends or removes hinderances, and puts bars or lets,<note place="margin">

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Shall ſpeak of theſe words, as they contain a propoſition aſſerting the Attribute of <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> which is the third in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the communicable attributes of God, and now to be ſpoken of. For the formality of the words, take onely this. <hi>Jehovah</hi> is to be exalted and worſhipped at his holy hill, why? becauſe he is holy: <hi>For the Lord our God is holy.</hi> But why might it not have been ſaid, <hi>exhalt the Lord our God, and worſhip at his holy hill for the Lord our God is,</hi> a good God, or a jealous God, or a mercifull God? I anſwer, It is true, there is enough in every attribute to draw ſouls unto God, and to move us to exalt him, and to allure us to worſhip him: but yet when I ſhall have ſhewed you what holines in God is, ye will eaſily be made to ſee that the conſideration of holineſſe will be a principal ground and cauſe to exalt him, and to worſhip at his holy hill. A thing is ſaid to be holy, firſt, when it is ſeparated from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe to the ſervice of God. So the Utenſils of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to the very Diſhes, Tongs and Snuffers were holy; that is, were ſeparated unto God. And in this regard, <hi>the Lord our God is holy;</hi> for from all eternity, he was ſeparated from all other objects to himſelf, to love himſelf, to take delight in himſelf: God is dedicated to himſelf from everlaſting, and his honour he will never give to any other: and therefore exalt him, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, ſet him high, truſt in him, honour him <hi>for he is holy,</hi> he is all for himſelf, he is eternally dedicated to himſelf, and will make ſuch know that do not exalt him, what it is to diſpleaſe ſo jealous, ſo holy a God. It is true, ſelf-love in men is very often inordinate, extreamly, and ſo very vicious; but in God it is a glorious beam, it is his holineſſe. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe there is none other meet to be an object of Gods love but himſelf. So this is the firſt acceptation of the word
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168364:37"/> holy, and you be according to this taking of the word, God is holy, that is, dedicated to himſelfe, and therefore that he is to be exalted and worſhipped, becauſe he is ſo holy as hath been ſaid. He is all for his own glory, all for himſelf; he never in the leaſt action aimed at any thing (nor will nor) indeed (can) but himſelfe. There are many things which aſſerted of men (as I hinted before) do render them very blameable yea unholy. <hi>As to looke after their own, Phillip.</hi> 2.4. To be lovers of there own ſelves 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2 and the like; Which aſcerted of God do glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſet out his holineſſe. And ſo alſo in men, holineſſe is a ſeparation from the world unto God, holy perſons, are perſons dedicated to God. Thus have you the firſt acceptation of the word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Holines ſomtimes ſignifies puritie. Yea know in our uſuall manner of ſpeaking, we do make holines and purity <hi>Synonimaes,</hi> as in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>therefore that (holy thing) which ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the ſonne of God.</hi> To be holy is to be imaculate, that is, <hi>ſine macula</hi> without ſpot, or blot, to be agreeable and conform to the holy law of God. <hi>Holines</hi> (ſaith a late writer) <hi>doth conſiſt in a compleate uniformitie, and conformitie to the will of God wholy.</hi> Some are firſt table Chriſtians, others ſecond table Chriſtians: Some hote in acts of religion that are could in juſtice: ſome are very honeſt and juſt to men that have no delight in communion with God, but <hi>James</hi> 2.10. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall keepe the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> He that breaks one linke of a chaine, breakes the chaine. One holy nature gave every commandement, how can there be a ſtate of holines without equal reſpect to all? <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed when I have reſpect to all thy Commandements</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſalme</hi> 119 6. And againe, <hi>I have refrained my feet from (every) evill way, ver.</hi> 101. To loſe our will in the will of God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. So this in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 4 34. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them</hi> (to wit) to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> that had prayed him to eate ſome meat. <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me and to finiſh his work.</hi> And <hi>Math.</hi> 26.39. <hi>and</hi> 42. <hi>verſes. Nevertheleſſe, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And <hi>thy will be done,</hi> this was holines in Chriſt. In this ſenſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and rightouſnes in Scripture do often ſignifie one and the ſame thing. I ſay (often) not (alwaies) for where the two words do come together, as <hi>Luke</hi> 1.75. <hi>In holines and righteouſnes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168364:38"/> before him all the dayes of our life;</hi> we may underſtand moſt fitly by <hi>holines</hi> the duties of the firſt table, and by <hi>righteouſnes</hi> the yelld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of obedience to the duties of the ſecond table. But I ſay ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines is ſometimes put for righteouſnes, and righteouſnes in like manner for holines. As <hi>Pſalme</hi> 16.3. <hi>David</hi> declares that his delight is in the Saints (or holy ones) that are in the earth, which he affirms to be the excellent, or ſuch as excel in verture. And therefore ſome do define holines to be moral goodnes which is a perfection of holines in life and converſation; a perfection of manners in act and habite as the Schoolmen call it. So we account righteous livers to be Saints. And becauſe there are none perfectly holy in this life, we cannot gain ſay the Popiſh Schoolmen in that ſence, that aver and teach none to be properly holy in his life, I ſay if they mean by properly holy, perfectly holy. For to make a man holy, there muſt be in him a perfection of habite and converſation agreeable to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall law of God. And as nothing is weight till it counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the weight that is ſet againſt it; ſo no mans life is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, that is perfectly holy; untill it be exactly anſwerable to the holy law of God, which cannot be ſaid of any man in this life until he come <hi>unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the fulnes of Chriſt. Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. It is true Chriſt was full weight according to the weight-ſtones of Gods eternal law, he was full meaſure according to that met-yard, but ſo was never any man elſe holy or righteous, perfectly I meane and exactly. This (by the way let me tell you) is one cauſe, why, when an emenient perſon dies in Popiſh countries, whom they judge fit to be canonized for a Saint; they let a hundred years paſſe after his death before they do it, allowing a conſiderable time for the purgatory-purgations of his ſoule before he paſſe for a Saint. But yet though properly, when by it we mean compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, none be holy in this life: Yet are there holy one on earth, to whom the holy, eternal morall law of God is a rule. And there are ſome, who though they cannot keepe all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; Yet they have reſpect unto them all. Such a one was <hi>David Pſ.</hi> 119.6. And <hi>ver.</hi> 111. he ſaith. <hi>Thy teſtimony, have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoycing of my heart</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 112 <hi>I have inclined my heart to performe thy ſtatute, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way even unto the end.</hi> But to proceede in ſhewing you what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:168364:38"/> is according to this ſecond uſe of the word. I have ſaid it is a conformity to the eternal law of God, and ſo it is. For as the conception of the divine mind is the meaſure of natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and of that being that is in all things; So the eternal law is the meſure and rule of morall perfection, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of a reaſonable nature in all good workes. He is holy therefore whoſe affection and manners do exactly agree to the eternall law of God. But here falls in a queſtion by the way that calls for an anſwer. To wit, whether all acts of obedience required now were required ever, and ſuch as have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired heretofore are ſtill required? To which I anſwer ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That Obedience to Gods mind is ſtill required,<note place="margin">Moralia ſunt aeternae verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> and for all moralls they are ſtill the ſame: But God hath been pleaſed to make poſitive lawes, ſome ceremonical, ſome judiciall which are now out of date. He trained up the Jewes under them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but upon the diſſolution of their common wealth, their judicial lawes ceaſed to be of uſe: And upon the comming of Chriſt to be a ſacrifice for the ſins of mankinde, the ceremonies as ſhadows of good things to come did fly away. And ſo alſo we now in Goſpel times, have our proper Goſpel laws, which the Jewes had not. But yet the moral law is ſtill one and the ſame, and of it not one jot or title ſhall ever be altered or made void. Well then, let us come to ſome iſſue. A man of an upright life and converſation is a holy man. Ye ſee what holines is in man, let us a little take a view of Angels, thoſe holy celeſtial flames: And we ſhall find that they are holy in both the formentioned reſpects. For they make Gods glory, the end of their actions, being given up to him, and to his honour: and there is no blemiſh in their obedience: None in their nature, none in their lives. It is true their holines is but finite becauſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and therefore periſhable holines in it ſelfe: for they might fall if they were not ſupported, &amp; thoſe Angels that fell at firſt were holy. Yea it is by the grace and decree of God that theſe elect Angels do and ſhall continue holy, as it alſo is, that the Saints-ſeparate from the world unto God, do not return to the world againe. Yea this is true of the holines and hapynes of Angels and ſaints in heaven. One thing more, touching the holy Ghoſt who in this ſenſe is called holy, not as he is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, but as he is the giver and worker of holines and makes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:168364:39"/> men conformable to the law of God. And therefore he is called God the holy Ghoſt or holy ſpirit, al the three perſons, Fatner, Son, &amp; Spirit are holy eſſentially; but the third perſon is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the holy Ghoſt or holy Spirit, becauſe he it is that worketh holines, and frameth your Spirits ſuteable to the holy law of God. Now if holines be ſuch a conformitie in men to Gods law, what glory is there in Gods holy conformitie to his own mind and law, as you will heare when we come to it. And in the mean time judge whether there be not ſufficient ground of calling upon men to exalt the Lord our God and to worſhip at his holy hill, in the rememberance of his holines, becauſe he is a holy God, becauſe he never required any thing of any man that was not holy, juſt and good; it is meet ſuch a one ſhould be exalted and ſet high, worſhiped and honoured. Therefore Worſhip for he is holy both wayes, in both accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the word he is dedicated to his owne glory and ſo he is holy, and he is perfectly, juſt and holy, <hi>righteous in all his wayes and holy in all his works. Pſ.</hi> 145.17. Therefore exalt the Lord our God, therefore worſhip him. Ye ſee the emphaſis of the reaſon, and why the conſideration of the attribute of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is rather then of another attribute, made the ground of this inculcated exhortation of exalting and worſhiping God.</p>
            <p>Now as in other Attributes formerly handled, ſo in this I ſhall ſpeak of theſe three propoſitions out of this Scripture.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That holineſse is an attribute of God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>that it is a Communicable attribute.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>That Holines in God is Infinite and incomprehenſible.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, that holines is an attribute of God. Let thoſe things be remembred that have been ſpoken of the twofold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the word holy, and we ſhall find that both are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently true of God. He is all for himſelfe, he will not give his honour to another; <hi>Herod</hi> ſhall be ſmitten by an Angel and eaten of wormes for not giving God his glory, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.23. Selfe love (as you have formerly heard) affirmed of men ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them ugly, but it is a glorious attribute of God. And then alſo the conformity that is in God between his mind and will (that I may ſo expreſſe it) evinceth this to be true, that the Lord our God is holy. And thus we may ſay, the will of God, the actings of God, are conformable to the eternall law of God; but yet the holines of God is of a far higher conſideration then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168364:39"/> the holines of men or angles. For the will of God and his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not to be thought to be conformable in an accidentary manner to an eternal law; but eſſentially and from within himſelf, not by diverſe or various vertues, but by his eſſence as it commeth under the conſideration of a will, he is holy: even as the ſame one infinite eſſence comming under the conſideration of a mind, is ſaid to be moſt wiſe, yea wiſdome it ſelfe, ſo that is (as it were) the ordering of Gods acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to his underſtanding which is called the holines of God. There was never a wiſe action or word in the world, but it came out of Gods head, nor never a good, right, or holy action, but came out at his heart: Again where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the eternal law doth ſpring from the divine eſſence which as it is the firſt originall of all entitative perfections: ſo alſo of all morall perfection, and of all the rectitude of the affection and converſation: It then appeareth, that as holines in men and Angles doth ſtand in conjunction with God in affection, ſo God moſt conjoyned to himſelf, both by nature and by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of love muſt needs be exactly holy, according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſchools. <hi>Amor Dei eſt ſanctitate, The love of God is holines,</hi> becauſe in men it ariſeth from the knowledge of his excellency which draws their ſouls to God. Now therfore, no creature can be holy as God is, becauſe no man doth know God as he knows himſelf. You know the ſaying, <hi>ignoti nulla cupido</hi> of a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known there is no deſire. The reaſon we love God no more, is, becauſe we know him no better. All our want of love to God, flows from our ignorance of him, he is holy among men that loves God moſt, and he will love more then others that hath a greater knowledge of God then others. God knows himſelfe and loves himſelf, and this is his holines; Yea he ſo adhears to himſelfe, that he will caſt downe all things, rather then ſuffer his honour to be abaſed. Laſtly in the application of the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of the word holines to God, you muſt know, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines ſtandeth in puritie of ſoule, free from all contagion and ſpot of ſin; therefore God is holy in himſelf without regard to an eternal law to be meaſured by. There is the holines of obeying a law, and the holines of being a law. There is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted holines and an uncreated holines. There is a regulating holines and a regulated holines. Holines in man is a compleate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168364:40"/> conformitie to the will of God: but in God there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate eſſentiall will, and an eſſentiall freedom from the leaſt ſpot of ſinne. In Chriſt as man was an exact conformitie and ſubmiſſion to his father wil, even contray to his creaturely will. But in God there is much more for he eſſentially is holy, and therefore cannot be meaſured by a law. By this time you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (I truſt) what holines is, which is an attribute of God: yet for further Diſcovery of God unto you I will ſpeake of the diverſe wayes, that God is ſaid to be holy, diſtinctly, properly, and perentically ſo, as none but him can be ſo ſaid to be holy as he is.<note place="margin">Leſſius.</note> God is ſaid to be holy five manner of waies according to the doctrine of the ſchooles. Firſt Radically, becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature is the firſt root and originall fountaine of all ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie and puritie. For from the eſſence of God, in our manner of conceiving things, both the eternall law, and all love in God of himſelf and all purity (called by ſome the chaſtity of God) doth flow and come.<note place="margin">Schaerpius.</note> For although there be not in God a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of nature in any regard; yet we muſt conceive in him a prioritie of order. To clear up this by familiar inſtances or ſimilitudes, though the beames of the ſun be aſſoone in, in nature as the ſun, yet we muſt account the ſunne to be the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall cauſe of thoſe beames. So alſo aſſoone as there is fire there is light and heate, yet is the fire in order to be conceived before either of them. And ſo now, you may ſee my meaning, when I ſay holines is radically in God. I meane the eſſence of God is the radicall cauſe, roote and fountain of that holines which is in God. As God the ſonne hath alwaies been the ſonne of God; and begotten from everlaſting, and is called the wiſdome and word of God. So upon the ſame account the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is the love and holines of the Godhead and divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſo proceedeth from the father, and the ſonne; this helpeth us to diſcerne ſome what of the great myſtery of the Trinitie. And ſo although not the ſame truth yet a truth like unto this would I hold forth in this Doctrine of radicall ſanctitie.</p>
            <p>Secondly God, is objectively holy, becauſe he is the object of all holines. For not only it is true of the holines of angels men, but even of the holines of God, that it is placed in the love of, and conjunction with God. God is the ſupream of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168364:40"/> all things and moſt ſimple and pure, and the cheifeſt purity, is in cleaving to him, and purity is holines or the chaſtity of God therefore God is holy objectively, as the meaſure of all holines, and the fit object of ſelfe love. For as in men impurity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by touching things below, as when our faces are ſoule or our garments dirty; And in our ſoules there is defilement by cleaving inordinatly to the world and worldly things: ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſprings by acquaintance with things above, when our affections do aſcend to high and more noble things, and do ſtick to them. And ſo God leaveth to himſelf and is the object and meaſure of his own holines.</p>
            <p>Thirdly God, is holy exemplarily in manner of a rule or coppy. The conformitie of the ſoule and life of man to the eternal law is true holines, ſuch conformity is in God to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and law, though not becauſe it is his law which is the rule of holines.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, formally God is holy, he cleaves to himſelfe who is moſt pure, and is therefore formally holy. God is the love of himſelfe this is his holines, and becauſe he loveth himſelfe infinitely, as he is lovely infinitly, therefore he is infinitely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Yea God in the love of all his creatures is holy, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 145 17. <hi>He is holy in all his workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He loves them for his own ſake. <hi>Sanctum eſſe, eſt amare De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, et gloriam ipſius in omnibus procurare. To be holy is to love God and to ſeeke his glory in all things.</hi> And ſo he is holy in all his workes.</p>
            <p>And Secondly he is holy in all his works, becauſe they are exactly conformable to the rectitude of the eternall law. <hi>Quia tam perfecte vult rectitudinem quam perfecte illam concipit. He works as perfectly as he conceives perfectly.</hi> As is Gods judgment ſo is his will: And hence it is that the love of the Father is ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing great to Chriſt, <hi>for the father loveth the ſon, &amp;c. Joh.</hi> 5.20. Why ſhould God love the ſon more then any other creature; but becauſe he ſaw more of himſelf wrought in the ſonne, then in any other creature. Love is an inclination of the will to that thing which is good, and thereupon the ſoul of God runs out to Chriſt who was altogether lovely: this is formal holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in God, this is the formality of this attribute in God, he loveth himſelf in his love to the creatures. All the actions of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:168364:41"/> God proceede from an holy ſpirit, from a ſpirit of holines: As hath beene ſaid already, holineſs is to love God, to ſeek Gods glory, to love ones ſelfe in God, and in this ſence God is certainly holy for he loves none as himſelfe and ſeekes and aimes at his owne glory in every thing he doth.</p>
            <p>And here (by the way) let me ſpeake a word of the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the holines of Saints. Is it not their love to God and Chriſt. And the Saints that makes them to delight in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him whom their ſoule loveth. Doubtles it is. <hi>My beloved (ſaith the ſpouſe) is whit and ruddy the chiefeſt among ten thouſand.</hi> Canticles 5.10. As it was ſaid by the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.8. <hi>Happy are thy men, Happy are thoſe thy ſervants which ſtand continually before thee, and which hear thy wiſdom:</hi> So much more may we ſay (as the ſpirit of holines maketh us to ſay.) Bleſſed are they that know Chriſt, and have of the graces of his Spirit. And here I muſt needs ſay once againe if God be holy, becauſe he loveth good men which are his choice work<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manſhip; then ſo are the Saints therein holy alſo, for they love wonderfully that choiſe maſter piece Chriſt, and all the Saints which <hi>are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, Eph.</hi> 2.10. And ſo by the rule of contraryes, as it is ſaid <hi>Pſalme</hi> 45.7. by way of propheſy and myſtically of Chriſt, <hi>Thou loveſt righteouſnes and hateſt wickednes &amp;c.</hi> God muſt needs hate ſin with an infinite hatred: for he loveth the rectitude of the eternall law, and therefore hateth what is contrary to it, for the ſinfullnes of ſinne is its contrariety to Gods eternall law. And then Secondly, God neceſſarily loveth his own goodnes and perfection, and therefore neceſſarily hateth ſinne which is contrary and repugnant to that goodnes. Repugnant I ſay, not as one forme to another, but as an inordinate thing to its rule and meaſure. Keep ſinne up and God muſt go downe, keepe God up, and ſinne muſt go down. You may as well expect to ſee the Ocean ſea burn to aſhes, or ſtones to fly upward, as look to ſee an union betweene God and ſinne, or that God ſhould not looke upon it with higheſt indignation. What ſinne is, you ſhould finde in every catechiſme almoſt, it is the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the holy law of God, even the leaſt ſinne doth turne aſide Gods love, and becauſe he is holy, it maketh his very ſoule to hate the perſons in whom it is. Sinne is like Coloquintida
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168364:41"/> in the Pot, and this I muſt tell you that when God ſmels it, he cannot but throw away pot and all, it is ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his holines. Where ever God ſees ſinne he runs at it preſently. If his owne ſon do but ſtand in the ſinners ſteede, though he had no ſinne of his owne, yet you ſee how the wrath of God ran out againſt him. And the reaſon is, Gods love of his law, which is his holines, of which ſin is the tranſgreſſion, and upon this account God muſt needs hate it. And this Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid a man of much acquaintance with God tells us, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>For thou art not a God that hath pleaſure in wickednes, neither ſhall evill dwell with thee, The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight, thou hateſt all workers of iniquitie,</hi> and ſo Iſaiah 1.24. Ah ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will eaſe me of mine adverſaries and avenge me of mine enemies.</hi> By which words the prophet meaneth, that God will not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, he will eaſe himſelfe; here is an alluſion to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of men,<note place="margin">Calv. in loc.</note> for even as wrath is nothing elſe but a deſire of revenge: ſo revenge it ſelfe alſo is a kind of contentment: for when any is revenged he is glad and ſatisfied. Thus the Lord ſaith, that he will ſatisfie himſelfe in chaſtiſing his enemies, as if it were a kind of recompence. And becauſe this holines of God doth ſo glorious ſhine-out in his hating of ſin, which is contrary both to his eternal law &amp; workings, in both Church and world, and alſo to the actings of Saints, acted by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of holines: I will a little faſten here and give you ſome evidence of the bitter hatred which is in God againſt ſinne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore when we ſhall ſee an all-mercifull God to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> deprive men and Angels of ſuch an infinite good, as himſelfe,<note place="margin">Evidences of Gods hating ſin.</note> certainly you muſt ſuppoſe there is ſome great cauſe &amp; reaſon for it, why, the fruition of God is the greateſt good, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells and men were his moſt excellent creatures: yet ſuch is Gods holines cauſing his hatred of ſinne that he tumbles man out of Paradiſe, and Angels out of heaven, here is one evidence of Gods hatred of ſinne and ſeveritie againſt ſinners.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, God doth not only deprive theſe prime crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſuch a goodnes, to wit, himſelf infinitly and eternally,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but alſo caſt them into extreame ſorrows, pains and torments. <hi>And the Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate</hi> (or principalitie) <hi>but loſt their owne habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkenes, unto the judgement of the great day,</hi> Jud. ver. 6. And
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168364:42"/> for men, who can be ignorant of theſe miſteries, ſinne hath brought upon all ſexes and ages even in this life, beſides thoſe everlaſting burnings, to the which all wicked ones are reſerved?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God will blot out all the good that ever men did, if that fall a ſinning once. <hi>If the righteous turneth away from his righteouſnes and committeth iniquitie, &amp;c. All his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned in his treſpaſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24.</note> 
               <hi>that he hath treſpaſſed; and in his ſinne that he hath ſinned, in them he ſhall die.</hi> If a man ſhould live many a yeare in ſerving God, and do great things for the people of God; Yet if he give out and ſin, and perſiſt and die in his ſinne, all his former good ſhould be blotted out.<note place="margin">Q. A.</note> But here comes a great queſtion, can a righteous man fall from his righteouſnes? To which I anſwer, It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, <hi>Ratione Decreti &amp; promiſſionis, in regard of Gods decree and promiſe:</hi> Yet we muſt know that as God only hath immortality eſſentially and immutably: ſo likwiſe all kindes of goodneſs are only in God firme and ſure. Saints might fall, Angels might fall, the Saints in heaven might fall and dy alſo againe, were it not that God holds them to their eſtates, he hath brought them unto, and will even as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 91.4. <hi>He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt: his truth ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler.</hi> But for more cleare and full anſwer to the place in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> You muſt know that the Holy Ghoſt meanes not truly gratious, neither is it the ſcope to prove falling from grace, but to cleare the Lords juſtice, and my ſcope is to ſhew the deadly hatred God beares to ſinne. And either by righteous in that place we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a moral, legal, righteous man, or elſe it is a caution to prevent a righteous mans falling, if we will underſtand it of Goſpel righteouſnes. Or laſtly, (as I intimated in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my Anſwer to his Queſtion) it may be true of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man conſidered in himſelfe, not in relation to God or Chriſt, that he may turne from his righteouſnes as Angels and Adam did. We have a rule conditional, ſuppoſitions are of things impoſſible, aſwell as of poſſibles, &amp; therefore make what ye will of the text, yee can never neceſſarily conclude, either with Bellarmine, that a man may, <hi>Exuare cor novum, put away a new heart,</hi> that faith may be loſt. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Inſt.</hi> c. 14. <hi>Quid clareus? quomodo quaeſo avertitur juſtus à juſticia, ſi fide ſola juſtificatur &amp; fides ſemel concepta extergui non poteſt?</hi> or with Arminians
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168364:42"/> that it is ſo evident, that every one may ſee it, that a juſt man may totally and finally fall away.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hominem ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum poſſe tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter de ficere.</hi> Ameſ. in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynod. de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. Sanct. c. 2.</note> Chriſt tells his diſciples that he would ſend the comforter, that he might abide with them forever, that he might dwell with them, and be in them <hi>John</hi> 14.16.17. But I muſt end this buſineſſe which is but by the by. God muſt needs hate ſin, ſeeing one ſin in the evening of a mans age perſiſted in unto death will make God forget, all former ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices done to him (this is the third evidence.)</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Gods willing the abaſed incarnation, and dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> death and paſſion of his ſonne, that ſinne might be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, is the higheſt diſcovery of his hatred towards it. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the blood of his owne ſon be able to remove ſin, it ſhall be laid down rather then God will endure it: ſo hateful is ſin, and ſo loathſome in the eyes of God. And therefore Soules, do but conſider this, ye that make light of ſin, ſee and conſider a little what ſinne is in the account of God, in whoſe ballance all things muſt be wayed. Yea, look upon the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſt to make <hi>his ſoule an offering for ſin,</hi> to lay down his pretious life that this ugly thing ſin ſo hateful to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines might be ſlain as well as ſatisfied for; and that Gods ſoul might be eaſed and comforted, juſtice being ſatisfied which the holy ſeveritie of God did call for. I have beene very long upon the formalitie of Gods holines, which as you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, is the fourth way or manner God is ſaid to be holy in.</p>
            <p>A Fifth, and indeed the laſt way or manner is, that God is ſaid to be holy, <hi>Eminently, and cauſally;</hi> as the fountain and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> begining of all ſanctitie in creatures. As he is the root of all holines, the object, the example <hi>viz.</hi> of and unto his own holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and formally holy, alſo (as hath largly been demonſtrated, So likewiſe to the creator of all creatures holines? He is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Efficient, Formall, Exemplary, and final cauſe. He hath (firſt) infuſed all holines (into Angels and men) which they have, he converteth men to himſelfe, he doth away the ſpots of their ſinnes, he plants in them the light of grace and good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All holines comes from him, and what have we, that we have not received from him, who only it is that makes men to differ? So that, God is cauſally holy, the efficient cauſe of all holines in the ſons of men. He it is that rooteth out ſin,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:168364:43"/> and cleanſeth them from filthines, and planteth in them holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by his holy ſpirit. And thus our God is holy as he doth effect holines. Secondly he gives the very ſpecies of holines. Holines (as I have told you) is placed in loving God, and his waies, Chriſt and his people: Now it is God that forms Chriſt in us, and gives a ſpirit of conformitie to him in holines. He is the formal cauſe of holines in creatures, not informing but in a higher way, &amp; without imperfection, <hi>we are transformed by the renewing of our mind, Rom.</hi> 12.2 The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the new creature, the change of the ſoule, (as the worke is variouſly termed) is wholy from God. <hi>And ſo their people</hi> come to be <hi>willing in the day of Gods power, in the beauties of holines Pſ.</hi> 110.3. Then when they have a holy frame of ſpirit, they being to value ordinances, and <hi>run too and fro for the increaſe of their knowledge, Daniel</hi> 12.4. they cleave unto God, and one to another, <hi>praying in the Holy Ghoſt Jude. ver</hi> 20. <hi>and ſubmiting themſelves one to another in the feare of God Epheſ.</hi> 5.21. Even as the father loveth the ſonne, and the ſonne loveth the father, and God loveth himſelfe becauſe of the holines in their divine eſſence: ſo it is with the Saints that are made to be holy and are renewed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God is exemplarily the cauſe of holines in creatures, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he hath laid a coppy before us according to which we ſhould ſquare our lives. He is <hi>principum exemplare.</hi> Not only the mind and will of God revealed in the ſcripture, but alſo the hiſtories of Gods dealings in point of holines, who would have us walk as he hath, and be holy as he is holy. And yet this is not all, we have a plaine familiar coppy, a demonſtration before our eys, I mean the behaviour and converſation of Chriſt in the daies of his fleſh, <hi>he hath left us an example, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. <hi>Such as walk according to</hi> theſe coppies and <hi>this rule, peace be on them and mercy, and upon the</hi> Holy <hi>Iſrael of God, Gal.</hi> 6.16.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, All the holines of the creature is directed unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4:"/> God and his glory, as unto its end. Therefore the creature is ſanctified and made holy, that it may be for God the utmoſt end; and honour him, and praiſe, and glorifie him. And take this for a truth, no action is any further holy then Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the end of it. The Phariſes almes, faſtnings and prayers, were materially good: but becauſe their owne praiſe and not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168364:43"/> Gods glory was that which they aimed at; this was that ſpoild all. And therefore (Chriſtians) well is that we have a Chriſt, for ſeeing God will no further look upon us then we perfectly aime at his glory in every thing; what would become of us had we not a Chriſt? Seeing ſelfe ends will ſo mingle themſelves with one beſt performances, have we not cauſe to bleſſe God for Jeſus Chriſt; 'tis our duty, and let it be our practice to bleſſe God for Jeſus Chriſt. To Summe up all. Holy men have holy minds, their holy minds are fixed upon God. The will, word, and workes of God and Chriſt, are coppyes before their eies; and laſtly, holy men ayme at Gods glory and not themſelves, (for they are ſwallowed up in God, and know whom they have believed) therefore I commend in all theſe reſpects, God to be eminently and cauſally holy. Now lets come to make ſome uſe and application of this truth,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes of the Attribute of holineſſe in God.</note> that the Lord our God is holy, that holines is an attribute of Gods. And firſt by way of information it teacheth us, that holines is not to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor ſuch as labor after it is not to be ſet light by, nor holy perſons deſpiſed. Wo therefore to thoſe that deſpiſe holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, this muſt needs be an heynous offence; why Sirs, what do ye mean? Holines is an attribute of God, and can that be baſe or deſpicable, which God takes, and makes to be one of his owne attributes, one of his names which muſt not be taken in vaine; much leſſe not trampled upon. Are ſuch to be blamed that deſire to be like God? to be holy as their father which is in heaven is holy? what horrible wickedneſſe is this! to mock at holy people, as to twit them with holineſſe, is to mock at God: thoſe that do ſo, are like unto ſuch wretched ſervants in a houſe, as will dog and miſuſe a childe in the family, becauſe it is like his father, whom they yet take wages off and live by, and can not live with out: little do men think to what a pitch of ſinfulneſſe their carriage this way doth amount unto: though many think it nothing to mock at holy people, yet is it a very great ſinne: And yet what is more in diſgrace then holyneſſe? who more deſpiſed then pure and holy ſoules? Oh theſe are your pure folkes, theſe are the holy ſect, and the like ſcoffing ſpeeches. If a man do but looke towards the wayes of holynes, he is ſtreightway had in deriſion by prophane people. How do parents abuſe their owne children even among us in this place,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168364:44"/> if they do but looke towards Sion, and even weep for mad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alas poore ſoules! Oh that I had but bowells to pitty you as there is cauſe. Do ye know what ye do? Let me tell you, yee mock at that which muſt be in your ſelves or ye ſhall not ſee God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>and holyneſſe</hi> without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord; yea ye mock at that without which ye cannot ſerve the Lord. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24 19. <hi>Ye cannot ſerve the Lord for he is an holy God, &amp;c.</hi> Such as deſpiſe holyneſſe cannot ſerve God, ſo this is the firſt uſe. If you ſhould have thoughts of indignation againſt people becauſe they be holy, ye would plainly declare that ye are none of Gods ſervants, none of his worſhippers, and as firſt I ſaid, that ye ſhall not ſee his face in mercy, ſo much for that; they that labour to be holy are not to be condemned, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe which is an attribute of God contemned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If holineſſe be an attribute of God, then it further <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> teacheth us, that God muſt needs like of holineſſe and delight in holy perſons. For all Gods attributes are pleaſing to him: and this being one of them, he muſt needs take pleaſure in this. This clearly follows, where God doth finde but a ſparkle of himſelf, he muſt delight neceſſarily in it, becauſe of his holineſs (as hath been abundantly manifeſted in the foregoing part of this diſcourſe) he runs with joy to his the workmanſhip of his own ſpirit. And this is not onely a Uſe of information, but of comfort alſo; exceeding great comfort to thoſe that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of this wid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore the excellency herof thus conſidred ſhould never let us be quiet til we have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſome evidence, that we have in ſome meaſure attained unto this holines, even holines which is one of Gods attributes.</p>
            <p>Secondly conſider this too, holines is a thing which every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> man is without. There is not ſo much as one ſparkle of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in any man by nature: for we are wholy defiled with ſin. <hi>Ever imagination of the thoughts of mans heart is only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6 5. <hi>How can man be cleane that is borne of a Woman</hi> Job 25.4. the interrogation there is a vehement negation? <hi>How can,</hi> that is, it cannot be; <hi>But we are all as an uncleane thing, and all our righteouſnes are as filthy rags.</hi> Iſaiah 64.6. <hi>There is none righteous no not one, there is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God.</hi> Rom. 3.10.11. Holines you ſee by nature. Every man (ſaith one) is borne with his face to ſin, and his backe to holines. And yet this holines is of abſolute neceſſitie: Riches life, health, freinds are good things? But yet they are not of no ſuch neceſſity, but holines is. Without it no man ſhall ſee the Lord, <hi>Heb</hi> 12 14. A man may ſee the Lord without peace, with out wealth, but not without holines be ſure of that. No holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, no heaven. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. <hi>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth.</hi> Thoſe that are without holines muſt abide without heaven. Heaven Gates are ſhut againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy perſons. They that do looke for ſalvation muſt be holy, muſt be waſhed, as ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jer</hi> 4. cap. 14. <hi>O Jeruſalem
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168364:45"/> waſh thine heart from wickednes that thou maiſt be ſaved.</hi> This is the ſecond motive to move us with earneſtnes to ſeeke after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, conſidering the abſolute neceſſitie of it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third motive is an encouraging one, to wit, that holines is to be had, if you will but take pain for it. I do not preſſe you upon impoſſibilities. It is true, holines is an attribute of God, and ſome of his attributes be incommunicable, but this is communicable to man. And ſo I come unto the next, to wit the ſecond propoſition to be ſpoken of in this attribute (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my methode obſerved in diſpatching all the other that have formerly beene handled) and it is. That holines is communicable to mankind,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> that it is a communicable atribute. But that I be not miſtaken, or miſunderſtood, you muſt know that I mean not holines or any other attribute is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it is an attribute of God. For God cannot part with any thing that is eſſentially his or rather himſelfe; as all Gods at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are: But this is it that I mean, that here is ſomething like holines in God, which God communicateth. That like diſpoſitions are to be found in men and Angels that are in God. That as God is ſaid to be holy, ſo there is a holines in men. But whereas in men holines is finite, imperfect &amp; mutable; neither that, nor any other attribute is ſuch in God, who is one moſt ſimple eſſence, and not made up of ſeveral ingredients. There is nothing in God, which is not God, His wiſdome, power, goodneſſe holines is one, and the ſame moſt ſimple infinite and immutable eſſence. But to returne whence I digreſſed. Holines is a communicable attribute, it doth not ſo abide in God as for man to have no ſuch propertie.<note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> It is communicated as may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be ſeen firſt in the creation of both Angels and men. When God made <hi>Adam</hi> he was a holy man: And therefore we may well argue that holines is to be had,<note place="margin">Ab eſſe ad poſſe valet argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</note> becauſe it hath been had.</p>
            <p>Secondly God hath likewiſe communicated it in regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>And that ye put on the new man which after God is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> created in righteouſnes and true holines.</hi> So then, if God made man holy at firſt and make many holy again, daily by <hi>renewing them in the ſpirit of their minds</hi> Epheſ. 4.23. Then it ſtands for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable truth in both theſe reſpects, that holines is to be had,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>
               </label> that it is a communicable thing. And therefore we may hence conclude the true cauſe, that ſo many men do want holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:168364:45"/> to be in themſelves, and not in God. What is the reaſon that ſo many are altogether deſtitute of this grace, that they have not ſo much as one graine of it in their hearts, or the leaſt ſigne of it in their lives? Surely it is becauſe people do not give themſelves to uſe the meanes to obtaine it, they will not walke in thoſe waies in which it is to be had. The fault is not in God but in themſelves. Soules, God call's you to be holy, and ſends his meſſengers to invite you to come to him, that ye may be holy, he calls upon you to turn from your evill waies, he ſometimes allures, he would you ſhould be holy, but ye will not, God hath done his part. He may ſay of you as once he did of <hi>Iſrael, Iſaiah.</hi> 5.4. <hi>What could be done more to my Vineyard that I have not done in it?</hi> There hath been nothing wanting in God, and yet inſteed of the ſweete and pleaſant grapes of holines, he hath had nothing elſe, but wilde grapes from us: inſteed of holines, profaneſſe, and wickednes: And that which is ſad to conſider, the more God calls men to holines, the further do they run from him into all ſin and wickednes. <hi>Of what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſe ye ſhall ſuch be thought worthy, that tread under-foot the Son of God and count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and do deſpite unto the ſpirit of grace;</hi> Heb. 10 29. How will men be able to anſwer this before <hi>our God</hi> who <hi>is a conſuming fire?</hi> How do ye thinke to ſtand in the judgment: O yee ſinners, and in the congregation of the righteous in that day? How can ye ever expect to reſt in Gods holy hill and continue in unholines. What deſperate madnes is this? Surely, Chriſt will come and he will ſeparate between the ſheep and the goates, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the holy from the unholy: you ſhall anſwer for your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes and baſe carriage towards the Lord and his people. This is the firſt uſe, the fault is not in God, that people are not holy, but the fault is in themſelves, If now ye be damned ye may thank your ſelves: your deſtruction will be of your ſelves. For God would have you holy, he ſtands at the doore and knocks, The Lord grant that this may be thought on, that hath been ſaid. So much for the firſt uſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly it teacheth us for our everlaſting comfort, that ſuch as do deſire holines may have it from the hands of God.<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
               </label> If ye will be holy ye may: If ye will ſay each one of ye, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me holy, as it is written of the Leaper,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168364:46"/> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean.</hi> That Jeſus <hi>put forth his hand and touched him ſaying, I will, be thou clean,</hi> v. 3. So will he put forth his hand and ſay, I will, be thou holy. Ye cannot be more willing, nor ſo much neither, to have holines as God is to give it. We reade of Paul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 89. How be ſought the Lord when the thorne in the fleſh was ſent him, and what anſwer he had, <hi>viz.</hi> to wit, that <hi>God's grace was ſufficient for him:</hi> Now have you bad natures? bad hearts? remember God is both able and willing to give you new natures, and to creat in you cleane hearts. If you will cry unto him, and complaine of your ſtony hearts: he can take away theſe hearts of ſtone, and give you hearts of fleſh. If you groane under ſinne with a deſire to be rid of it, know this for your eternal comfort that the worke of grace is begun in you already. The work I ſay is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and he that hath begun that good work will perfect it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of Jeſus Chriſt. Never was there a ſoule that groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after holines, ſincerity, that ever periſhed for the want of it. Theſe groanes could not be, but by the ſpirit of Chriſt, and where the Spirit of Chriſt is, there is Chriſts dwelling, and where Chriſt dwelleth, there is true faith. You that deſire holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that hunger and thirſt after righteouſnes are pronounced bleſſed. You are in Chriſts ſchoole though but in the loweſt forme.</p>

And yet again, conſider the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>4</label> great danger if we dy without holines. <hi>Without it we cannot ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. no holines, no heaven. And therefore upon theſe and ſuch like conſiderations, we ſhould be ſtirred up to put to it, to the purpoſe, and labour to be holy as God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I am loath to leave this point: therefore for an other motive; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>5</label> conſider that man that deſires to do a thing, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means, as a good rule, a good coppie hath great ground of hope that he ſhall obtaine what he would have, and attaine
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168364:46"/> unto that which he laboureth for: Now Beloved what a copy have we to walke by? Even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt who is ſent from heaven to us that we might writ after him. God (its true) is a coppy. <hi>Be ye holy for I am holy.</hi> But that indeed was a very hard one for us to writ by. But now he hath given us a living law in the Lord Jeſus, who is made unto us of him wiſdome and righteouſnes and ſanctification, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Now he hath given us his owne ſon to draw out every letter before our eies, that ſo we might the better write after him. Good men be bleſſings, whoſe examples are to be followed: but there is no man ſo good, but hath his faylings and defects. But now Chriſt hath neither ſpot, nor wrinckle, nor any ſuch thing in him: for he is full of knowledge, and likewiſe of the feare of the Lord. All ſorts may learne of him how to behave themſelves. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may learn of him how to behave themſelves towards their parents, ſubjects and people to Princes and Magiſtrates, in him we have a coppy for prayer, how alſo to be doing of good up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, to love our enemies, not to revile again when we are reviled. In things both concerning this life and the life to come, we have patterns in Chriſt to immitate. In Chriſt I ſay not as God, but as man indued with the graces of the Holy Ghoſt. And this is that living ooppie, which the holy God hath provided for us that we might be holy too.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, And yet this is not all. The Scriptures are left to be <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>6</label> a ſtanding rule and bleſſed meanes of ſanctification. <hi>John</hi> 15.3 <hi>Now ye are cleane through the words, which I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> The word of the goſpel is that which cleanſeth people. By it they are ſanctified as it is expreſſed in that heavenly prayer of Chriſt <hi>John</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy trueth, thy word is trueth.</hi> And ſo alſo <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26.27. <hi>That he might ſanctifie it</hi> (ſpeaking of the Church) <hi>with the waſhing of water by the word, that he might preſent it to himſelfe a glorious church not having ſpot or wrinkle of any ſuch thing: but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7ly. We have many outward favours, whereby God doth allure us into holines. Every outward bleſſing &amp; mercy ſhould <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>7</label> invite us to holines. As <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74.75.

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Let us ſtudy the Doctrine of holines or the new creature or the new man: that we may know what it is, and when we have it. It is an alluring Doctrine. It is called the image of God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>And that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteouſnes and true holines.</hi> Such as would have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney muſt learn how to tell it. Then are divers ſorts of moneys and coines abroad in the world, and therefore labour to know the King of heavens coyne. And learne to try it too from counterfeit, there is much falſe money going.</p>
            <p>I will a litle ſpeake of this holines, which I am now perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you to labour for and to ſeeke after.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It ſtandeth 1. in the renovation of the whol man, both in the ſpirits of our minde, and in the affections of our hearts. When our ſpirits and affections are renewed then we become holy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly it ſtands in giving up our ſelves wholy by a dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the uſe of the Almighty. So that we do not longer live unto our ſelves, but to him that died for us and roſe again:</p>
            <p>We ſhall the better ſee what this holines is, by its contrary to wit the old man, and the former converſation thereof. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues appeare the better and ſhine the more gloriouſly, by thoſe vices that are contrary to them. A faire beauty is the more lovely in a comely woman, when a blackmore ſtands by. A ſoile ſets forth a Diamond.<note place="margin">What the old man is;</note> And therefore that we may the better ſee the lovelineſſe of the new man, we will looke a little upon the old man. That therefore which is called the old man,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168364:47"/> is want of knowledg in the mind, and a delight in ignorance:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Want of ſubjection and conformity in the will and rebellion withall. Want of holines in the affections and proneſſe to evill. An aiming at a mans ſelf in all actions, or rather the diſeaſe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the ſoule is ſatisfied. <hi>A fullfilling the deſires of the fleſh.</hi> Epheſ, 2. verſe 3. Let us faſten here a litle. A blind mind, an ignorant ſoule, is not ſubject to the law of God; neither indeed can be. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. And therefore though God forbid men of this frame to love the world, yet they will love it ſtill, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> have no heart, no ſtomack to God and his wayes. This is the frame of the ſpirit of an unholy man. And therefore they that are ſuch make not God the end of their thoughts, word or actions. No nor indeed themſelves as creatures, ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is the blindnes of their mind and perverſnes of their ſpirits. Sicke ſoules muſt be humour'd or elſe they are quite undone they think, although in truth it fares with ſuch as with men and women that have ſick bodies, that uſe to long for that which will prove their bane. Their luſt make them fooles. They have no underſtanding, the eies of their mind are put out. They faſhion themſelves according to their luſt in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. They are as blind as beetles. They are like a man that is ſick of a feaver that muſt have could drink and other things, which his diſeaſe cals for, though it kill him. Theſe will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dy then yield to God, and hug that ſnake in their boſome which will ſting them to death at laſt. And thus ye ſee what unholines is. Tis true gracious men may ſlip, they may be overtaken in a fault: but it doth coſt them deare. If <hi>Peter</hi> deny Chriſt, he will weep bitterly. If <hi>David</hi> ſtep aſide as he did in the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> he will water his couch with his tears and make his bed to ſwim. But as for theſe poor unholy ſouls their caſe is ſad and diſmal: Never tell me ſay ſome of holines and exactnes: I will not, no, I will not, I will dy rather.<note place="margin">What holines is?</note> Such we read of in <hi>Jeremy, As for the words that thou ſpeakeſt, we will not do.</hi> And again, <hi>Let us not give heed to any of his words.</hi> Well Sirs, ſith there are among you ſuch as will not heare us ſpeak of God to you; Yet we will not ceaſe to ſpeake to God for you.</p>
            <p>And now let us ſee what holines is.<note place="margin">Three things in the ſoule.</note> It is indeed the reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all theſe defects which I have ſpoken of to you. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go any further in that matter, let me ſhew you three
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168364:48"/> things in the ſoule, Firſt, the ſubſtance thereof. Secondly, the faculties or powers of the ſoule. Thirdly, the qualities of theſe faculties. Ye have a fit reſemblance of theſe in an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of muſick, there is the inſtrument, the ſtrings, &amp; the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Now ye muſt know when Adam fell, the ſubſtance of his ſoul was the ſame afterward that it was before. The devils have the ſame ſubſtance in hell that they had when they were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Neither are the faculties of the ſoule loſt by the fall, but only the good qualities are defaced, that which we call the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of God. As firſt for the underſtanding, knowledge, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3 10. <hi>And have put on the new man,</hi> Saith the Apoſtle there, <hi>Which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him;</hi> where we may eaſily gather that holy ſouls are knowing ſouls, underſtanding what was loſt is found again. And then ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the will and affections, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſnes and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe;</hi> knowledge is oppoſed to ignorance, an ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is an ungodly perſon: And holineſſe and righteous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences and the luſts of the old man. To which if yee add one thing, to wit, ſincerity and truth, and an aiming at Gods glory, then ye have the body of holineſſe. So now ye ſee that an holy frame of the ſoul ſtandeth in the abſence of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evill and a poſitive quality and habit of goodnes. Some ſet it forth thus: Holineſſe reſpecteth God immediately, and is contained in the duties of the firſt Table. Righteouſnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth man and the creatures, and compriſeth the duties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the ſecond Table; Truth reſpects the manner how both the former are to be practiſed. Theſe make a perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in all the faculties of the ſoule, and are that created ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe which is communicated from God; as firſt to <hi>Adam</hi> in his creation; ſo ſince to all regenerated ones.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A ſeventh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to move us to labour for holines.</note>Be exhorted I ſay, again to get holineſs; and let me adde one conſideration more to ſtir you up to labour for holineſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the moſt holy men are the leaſt fearing men: <hi>Paul</hi> was of great courage, he had much holineſſe: 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Ye are witneſſes, and God alſo how holily, and juſtly, and unblamably we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves among you that believe.</hi> Therefore when the Viper leapt upon his hand he feared not: Polluted ſouls are full of fear.

The righteous alſo ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger:</hi> Job 17.9. ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.1. <hi>The righteous is bold as a Lyon: Nehemiah</hi> was an holy man, and would not fly) <hi>Should ſuch a man as I flee, ſaith he;</hi> Nehemiah 6.11. If God be ſanctified by us, he will be a ſanctuary to us. If Fortitude were of ſuch high account among Heathens, when it was but a virtue; what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem ſhould it have as a grace? Do but get holineſſe, and ye need not fear of ten thouſands of people that have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt you round about, as <hi>David</hi> did not, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 6. Though 40. men binde themſelves with an oath againſt a holy man; yet they can do him no harm. If <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> theaten the fiery furnace to the 3 Saints in <hi>Daniel;</hi> yet they will behold,<note place="margin">An Deus eſt in mundo pro ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilo Card. bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom.

               <hi>Daniel</hi> 3. from the 13. verſe to the 19th. A holy man need not fear any thing. Holineſſe will carry a man through the world. He that knows himſelf to be one of Gods holy ones. May bid defiance to all fears and dangers whatſoever. Holineſſe arms a man with armour of proof againſt all fears. What ſaid a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal being told of great danger, is God in the world for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? And another, if God have not care of me, why do I live? And now Chriſtians arm your ſelves againſt fears by holineſſe: fears of the world, fears of death, which God knows how ſoon may ſeize upon us. God will be a ſun and a ſhield to his holy ones. Summe up all theſe motives that have been made uſe of firſt and laſt. Holines is that which God commands: For the attaining of it, he hath given direction. He hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they that ask and ſeek for it, forget it: ye have ſeen the great danger they are in that want it: Ye have alſo heard what a coppy we have in Chriſt before our eyes, holineſs acted before our eys, as well as directions given. We have the Canon of the Scriptures enlarged, which God makes effectuall for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of holineſſe: Many outward gracious vouchſafe-ments, do we live under, which ſhould prevaile with us. And laſtly, ye have heard what a ſhield and buckler holines is, and what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, bold, and couragious men Saints and holy men do uſe to be. Remember alſo that wicked men have terrours and fears; their name is <hi>Mayor Miſſabib,</hi> fear on every ſide: That they ſhall never ſee the face of God in mercy, but ſhall be without. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168364:49"/> part they muſt from God with his curſe upon their backs into hell torments with the Devill and his Angels, and that for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more. When Saints, Gods holy ones, ſhall ſit at Gods right hand, where there is fulneſſe of joy and pleaſures forevermore. The Lord give us holy frame of ſpirit and grace to ſerve him in holineſſe and righteouſnes all the dayes of our life, <hi>Amen, amen.</hi> It remaineth that we ſpeak of the third particular in this attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of holineſſe: <hi>viz.</hi> That holineſſe in God is infinitely and incomprehenſible. Or thus, That God in reſpect of his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of holines is infinite and incomprehenſible.</p>
            <p>For firſt he is eſſentially holy. He is not accidentally holy. We reade <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6.3. Of the cry of the Seraphins one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hoaſts, the whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> The glory of Gods holines fills the whole world. holines in men is a quality, an accident, but it is not ſo in God, his holines is his eſſence, he is holy of himſelfe.</p>

So we have a paſſage in that ſong of Moſes, and of the Lambe which was ſung by the Seven Angels, <hi>Revelation</hi> 15. In the 4. <hi>verſe. For thou only art holy.</hi> In God alone is the univerſaltie of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. That holines which is in any creature addeth nothing worth the nothing to God: yea it is in God eminently, and the ſame in number. God I ſay is infinitely, &amp; incomprehenſibly holy. Therefore for the firſt uſe. Seeing this God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to us for a patterne that we ſhould be holy, as he is holy: we learn that a Chriſtian in the imitation of God in the matter of holines, cannot exceede meaſure. It is impoſſible for a man to be too holy. Contrary to the vaine opinion of many that think a man can be to holy: and are ready to blame others for their forwardnes this way. A fearefull ſinne. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of blaſphemy. Do not they blaſphemy that worthy name

            <p>But <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 7.16. Be not righteous over much. And if righteouſnes and holines ſignifie the ſame thing,<label type="milestone">

               </label> as we have beene taught it often doth: then how can this be tru that one cannot be too holy? To which I anſwer,<note place="margin">

               </note> it is moſt true, that if men will walk by wrong rules, and not by thoſe that God hath left to his Church; They may be ſuperſtitiouſly holy, Pope-holy (as we ſay.) But make the Scripture your rule, ye may then be as holy as you poſſibly can, and need not feare of exceeding. Yee need not feare of being righteous over much. Holines is a Sea that hath neither banks nor bottoms. Yee need not doubt of wanting ſea-room or depth of water. Yee need not doubt of being ſtreightned.

            <p>And Secondly this Doctrine of the infinitnes and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſiblenes of the holines of God,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> may teach us for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and for the bearing up of our ſpirits in times of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That God will beare up holines againſt all the world,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168364:50"/> Though all the men in the world and devills in hell, ſhould go to caſt it downe; Yet ſtand it muſt: for God will uphold it.

The gates of hell (much leſs poore worms breathing skind earth) ſhall not be able to prevaile againſt it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Seeing God is infinitely and incomprehenſibly holy:<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Then they that will imitate God muſt never ſtand at a ſtay in holines, they muſt ſtill go on with the motto of <hi>Charl's</hi> the fifth <hi>plus ultra,</hi> Once we can never be too holy I am ſure of that. There is one wo and feare gone of an extream in holines: O if we could as well avoid the danger of being too dull, and ſlow and backward; It were well. I therefore will provide ſome ſpurs,<note place="margin">Motives to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for more holineſſe.</note> ſome pregnant motives to ſtirre you up to labour to be holy, yet more and more.</p>
            <p>Firſt, know this for your encouragement, the more holines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ye have on earth, the more protection may ye expect from this holy God. Thoſe Saints that have beene eminent for holines have beene alſo eminent for ſalvations. God hath made ſuch ſee his ſalvation. As the three Saints <hi>Daniel</hi> the third, <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelfe chap. the ſixth, and many others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take this too, the more holines the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſurely while men ly under ſinne the face of God is hid from them, our comforts uſually do fall and riſe together with our holines. God ſups and dines with his holy ones. Conſolation is meaſured to us according to our holines.<note place="margin">God and a Saint do keep one table.</note> God cannot ſmile upon us while we are under the breach of any one of his lawes. Ye may ſee what became of <hi>Davids</hi> comfort upon his fall, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51.11. He there cries, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy ſpirit from me.</hi> And in the foregoing tenth <hi>verſe,</hi> he cries for a new creation. He hath ſo farre loſt his comfort that he thought he had loſt his grace. Careleſt walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may cauſe us to be dealt with all, as if we were reprobates and not the elect of God. For this (however ſome idle heads may prattle) I appeale to the experience of all the Saints of God: whether ever they found ſo much comfort and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, in their looſe as in their cloſe walking with him, certainly the clouds of ſinne where ever they be, will make the beames of Gods favour diſappeare unto the ſence of that ſoule.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:168364:50"/>
            <p>Thirdly, The more holines the more boldnes. I remember I have read a ſtory of a Conjurer that would have, the devill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> an old exact Chriſtian. But the devill told him againe, Twas but in vaine to meddle with him, he feared nothing. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoules feare not death, though it be the King of terrours. They can looke it in the face, and with Mr. <hi>Lawrance Saunders</hi> cry out welcome life, when they are at the ſtake: The righteous is bold as a lion. Holy <hi>Moſes</hi> talks with God face to face. The more holines the leſſe feare. A holy man knoweth that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can come amiſſe to him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The more holines the more acquaintance with God: Holines makes men great favourities in the court of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> heaven. Tis but aske and have for a holy ſoule. As it was ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> he could do any thing with God. Surely ye cannot imagine what power holy ſoules have in heaven.<note place="margin">Hic vir poteſt quicquid vult apud Deum.</note> 
               <hi>Elias</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his holines had great power: he prayed that it might not rain, and it rained not; and he prayed again that it might raine and it did raine. Holy <hi>Moſes</hi> holds the hands of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.</note> and and God begs him to let him go. If any in the world can prevaile with God, it muſt be ſuch as <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The more holines on earth, the more glory ſhall ye have in heaven. Though God ſave us not for our works, yet he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us according to them. The garland there wil be greater or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> leſſer according as the flowers we ſend, before thither, be more or leſſe. We muſt have <hi>Eſaus</hi> hands, if we expect <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſſing. <hi>Eſau</hi> ſignifies working. No good is to be expected by us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing good. He that expects to carry earth to heaven, muſt firſt ſtrive to bring heaven downe to earth. It is noted by ſome that the ſame word ſignifieth reward and working, to ſignifie they cannot be ſeparated. Holy ſouls ſhall dwell in Gods holy hill. Holines it called by ſome the Suburbs of heaven, and he that will enter into the City muſt paſſe through the Suburbs? To conclude this motive, if we be eminently holy here, we ſhall be eminently glorious hereafter.</p>
            <p>Summe up all: God will protect his holy ones. Comfort and peace ſhall be their portion even here, as <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119.165. <hi>Great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them. And great ſhall be the peace of thy children,</hi> Iſaiah 54.13. <hi>No names ſhall be to them,</hi> Pſalme 39.9. If we be all for God, God will be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168364:51"/> all for us. If we dedicate our ſelves to God, we ſhall find that he will be ours in the ſweeteſt injoyments. His ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences ſhall be over us, others are under generall providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only.<note place="margin">Extra mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſanctus perigrinalitur cum Domino.</note> He may carry them on his back, but you ſhall be ſure to ly in his boſome. His eye &amp; his heart both are alwayes upon his holy ones for God. And at laſt, fulnes of joy at his right-hand and pleaſure for evermore.</p>

            <p>WE have under the good hand of our living good and holy Lord God, gone through thoſe three attributes of life, goodnes naturall (or perfection) and morall goodnes (or holines) which was the laſt. This verſe is not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be handled and to be ſpoken of, for the ſake of three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attributes mentioned therein <hi>viz.</hi> goodnes (that is to ſay) benignitie, mercy; a fourth ſort (as I may call it) of goodnes;
<pb facs="tcp:168364:51"/> and truth which at laſt will come to be ſpoken of alſo, out of this verſe, which will be the Sixth in order of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable attribute of God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now begin to ſpeake of the goodnes of God, as it is called by the name of benignity, or ſweetneſſe, or uſefull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, out of theſe words; <hi>For the Lord is good.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The vulgar la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine hath it, <hi>Quoniam ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis Dominus.</hi>
               </note> By ſome it is read <hi>for the Lord is ſweet:</hi> by others, <hi>for the Lord is gracious.</hi> All comes to one at laſt, and will afford unto us a good ground to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of theſe three propoſitions (as we have formerly done in handling the other attributes) firſt, that goodnes, or benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, or uſefullnes, or a readineſſe to do good; is an attribute of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this attribute is communicable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that God in reſpect of this attribute is infinite and incomprehenſible.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, I ſhall not be long upon the proofe of it. In the 36. <hi>Pſalme</hi> the fifth verſe. <hi>For thou Lord art good, &amp;c.</hi> Lament 3.25. <hi>The Lord is good to them that waite for him, to the ſoule that ſeeketh him.</hi> The Church of God was now brought to a low condition (which was the cauſe of the making of this booke of the Lamentations. Then did ſhe yet bear up her ſelfe by this attribute of God, his goodnes. And this indeed is that Which encourageth God's people to ſeeke unto him in all their ſtreights, and in all their difficulties, the remembrance of his goodnes. This ſets a gracious ſoule to ſeeke him, becauſe he never ſhutteth up his hand nor ſtoppeth his eare to them. <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.7. <hi>The Lord is good, a ſtrong hold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth them that truſt in him.</hi> And here by the way we are to take notice, that there is a certaine kind of proportioning out of this goodnes, according to the workings of the Holy Ghoſt in any. For though God be good to all, there is a goodnes of God over all his work. Yet he is not good to all alike. There is a generall goodnes, &amp; particular goodnes, or peculiar good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. He is good to all men and to all things, with a generall goodnes. Juſt and unjuſt, evill and good, are under his ſhowres and Sun-blaſts. <hi>For he maketh his ſun to riſe on the evill and on the good, and ſendeth raine on the juſt and unjuſt.</hi> Math. 5.45. And he heareth and <hi>feedeth the young ravens when they cry.</hi> Pſalme. 147.4. But yet ther is a goodnes peculiarly appropriated unto
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:168364:52"/> his people that do waite upon him and ſeeks unto him. For this ſame waiting upon God and ſeeking unto him, is as it were a fetching up of the waters of goodnes out of the deepe well of that other goodnes (lately ſpoken of,) the infinitenes (I meane) and perfection of God, in which they ly, Seeking God and waiting on him, is (as it were) the applying of God. Ye know that if a wounded man had never ſo good plaiſters ly by him; if he do not make uſe of them by applying them to his wounds: they may feſter and rot, and ſo periſh, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his good ſalves. And although God be the moſt compleat, utmoſt, and abſolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e good at all to any, unleſſe he be applyed. O this is the goodnes which is proper to the Saints that waite on him. It ariſeth from that which is called all his goodnes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. And that is communicated in a double ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as it is naturally communicated to his onely ſon, and in this ſence God is onely good to his ſon, the ſecond perſon in the God head, to whom God naturally Communicates the divine eſſence: and ſo he is from everlaſting, the begetting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſecond perſon is from everlaſting the begotten ſon. This eſſential goodnes is proper to the ſonne of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a free communication of the goodnes of God unto his creatures,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> according to their ſeverall capacities. And therefore if the creature be not made capable it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of this goodnes from him: and that is the reaſon that beaſts partake not ſo much of the goodnes of God as men, nor naturall men as they that are gracious. Beaſts have not the goodnes men have, nor common men that goodnes the Saints have; becauſe they are not capable of it. And not only ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally but gradually too, is this goodnes of God communicated to the Saints: For the wider the mouth of the bottle is and the more capacious; the more is it able to take in and hold of any liquor. A man can hold more in his hand then a child in his. So according to the meaſure or degree of faith do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in, from &amp; of the goodnes of God. So that all our ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings &amp; ſtraightnings are from our ſelves, not from God. God would ſtill be giving out, but our narrow hearts are not able to take in. If we could open our mouths wide God would fill them full? Tis true, faith is the ſame in juſtification, be it weak or ſtrong, but it is not alike in enjoying good things from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168364:52"/> God. The hand of a child or a palſiman ſerves to bring meat to his mouth to feed them, but it cannot hold ſo faſt, nor work ſo well as ſtronger hands can. God doth communicat many good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to all his creatures, and ſome peculiar to reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but as ye are Sts. ye are capable of other goodneſſes, and have ſuch choiſe favors, as flie over the heads of other men and women, becauſe they are not capable of them. For inſtance, none are capable of the love of God in Chriſt unto ſalvation, but ſuch as have believed in Chriſt and received him, <hi>and to as many (only) as have received him is power given to become the ſonnes of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> John. 1.13. It is never the better that there is water in the Wels, if you have not a Well bucket to draw it up for your uſe. <hi>David</hi> hath a notable prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.4. <hi>Remember me O Lord, with the favour which thou beareſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy people: O viſite me with thy ſalvation.</hi> And therefore let wicked men know this, that though God be good, yet it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better for them in this ſence. I meane in regard of the love which he beareth to his people. Alas; ye want faith, ye are not of a perfect heart, what will ye be the better for the waters that ly in the Well of Gods al-ſufficient goodnes? Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than will tell you. <hi>That God is a good God,</hi> but he will leave out this, <hi>to them that feare him, and love him, and waite upon him.</hi> This is his Sophiſtry, theſe be his tricks, he dealt ſo with Chriſt in a quotation of Scripture, as ye may ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 4.6. He leaves out thoſe words (in all thy waies) He tels him of a promiſe to be kept and of a charge given to the Angels concerning him? but if ye reade <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.9.

Tis true, if he ſee that ye be in perplexitie about your ſins, and be in to tremble and to be afraid of the wrath of God: then he will faſt enough be telling you what a terrible God he is whom ye have ſinned againſt, that he may drive you to diſpaire. Thus would the

Ye may ſee God putting both together <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, mercifull and gratious, long ſuffring, and abundant in goodnes and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquitie, and tranſgreſſion and ſinne, and that will by no meanes clear the guilty, viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore when wicked men ſhall talke of the goodnes of God, I may ſay to them as <hi>Jehu</hi> did to <hi>Joram</hi> concerning peace, <hi>what haſt thou to do with peace? &amp;c.</hi> So, What have ye to do to talke of the goodnes of God, that do not ſeeke him nor waite upon him. I may ſay to ſuch, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did to that Lord, on whoſe hand the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> leaned (mentioned 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.2.) about the great plenty that ſhould be in <hi>Samaria:</hi> Behold thou ſhalt ſee it with thine eies, but ſhalt not eate thereof: So ſuch may heare and ſpeake of the unſpeakable goodnes of God, but they ſhall have no ſhare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. O! Tis true, there are rich and pretious promiſes made, but only to ſuch as love God and keepe his commandements, and take Chriſt to be their King, Prieſt and prophet: but grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe wretches muſt know that nothing remaines for them, but a fearfull expectation of vengence when God ſhall reveale his wrath upon the breakers of his law, &amp; upon the refuſers of his Chriſt. And therefore that Sathan may not carry you along in a fooles paradiſe, do not ſeparate thoſe attributes of God, which from all eternitie are joyned in one in God.

If ye will be welcome to God, ye muſt have the wedding garment, if ye will profit by my diſcourſe of the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full goodnes of God which I am now upon, ye muſt be the children of the promiſe, and have your veſſels uncovered, or elſe all the pretious liquor of the goodnes of God will run over.

               </gap>ſe; and then I ſhall come to the Uſes.</p>
            <p>It is true, it is naturall in God to be good, for it ariſeth out of his infinite perfection: but yet the acts thereof are free. From this diſpoſition commeth another attribute, to wit, love; of which we ſhall ſpeake hereafter, when we ſhall have finiſhed others, firſt in their order. But in the meane time, It is my work to ſhew you what this goodnes of God is, which I am now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:168364:53"/> It is in God a naturall propenſion to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to creatures according to their ſeverall capacities.<note place="margin">VVhat the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of God is?</note> And whereas I ſay it is a naturall propenſion, yet I do not meane that the acts of goodnes are ſo, for they are free. There was but one neceſſary and naturall act of goodnes in God: and that is the communicating of his whole eſſence which is of infinit perfection &amp; excellency: As inferior things are naturally prone to procreate ſomthing like and equall unto themſelves. But becauſe that which is altogether infinite cannot be multiplied, therefore the Divine eſſence doth not communicate it ſelfe by the production of a like eſſence diſtinct in number, as created things do (in which the eſſence which is in one ſuppoſitum doth produce an eſſence in another ſuppoſitum diſtinct innum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) but by the giving of himſelf, and as it were by replication, ſo as the ſame moſt ſimple nature in number is in three ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences diſtinct in number. Yet this communication ſith it is natural, the proneneſſe unto it; is it not to be called benignity (of which I am now ſpeaking) but it is a naturall production of a perſon and communication of a nature. And we may call it fertility or fecundity. But goodnes is a free communicating to inferior. Which in God, although it ſpring from his infinite goodnes or perfection, as the former communication of the whole eſſence; and be alſo naturall: yet the acts thereof are free.</p>
            <p>And this goodnes of God communicated to creatures is generall to all, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.9. <hi>The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his workes.</hi> and verſes 15.16. <hi>The eies of all waite upon thee: and thou giveſt them their meate in due ſeaſon. Thou openeſt thy hand and ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living creature.</hi> But yet more eſpecially to the rational and intellectuall creatures men and Angles, which only by underſtanding and will are made capable of the divine goodnes. Theſe angelicall and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane natures God hath made far more capable of his goodnes, and hath adorned them with many gifts of his good will. And for man which he ſaw would ſtand in neede of many helpes, he made all other things to be uſefull for him, out of Gods goodnes and benignity is all this done: That the goodnes of humane being, night be hereby made the more ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable unto the ſons of men. In this reſpect he is ſaid to be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:168364:54"/> 
               <hi>the Saviour of all men</hi> 1 Tim. 4.10. preſerving them from many dangers, and relieving and comforting them with the ſervice of his other creatures. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.45. <hi>He maketh his ſun to riſe on the evill and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt.</hi> Thus goodnes is communicated to man as man. But, Thirdly Gods goodnes is not only generall to all creatures, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to mankind: but ſingular to his Church; not only in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them means of ſalvation, and deliverance from the curſe, but to many of them vouchſafing the ſenſe of his choiſeſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, in remiſſion of ſinnes, gifts of the ſpirit, and life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fullnes of joy reſerved for us at the right hand of God. O what a goodly garden of the goodnes of God is the whole creation! Even Devills have a ſhare in regard of their natures, it is angelicall, ſuch a nature as the beſt and wiſeſt, and moſt knowing of the ſonnes of men can little tell what to make of it. In ſo much that even in Chriſts time among the Jews it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came doubtfull whether there were any ſuch creatures as Angels at all, and by a conſiderable ſect, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sadduces was held in the Negative. I ſay the wonderfull goodnes which God hath communicated to Angels in general, as Angels is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our apprehenſion. They are glorious intellectual crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they come not by their knowledge of truthes as we do: admirable ſhares have they in the generall goodnes of God to that ſpeciall kind of creature. And for the ſoules of men firſt: as men I mean. The poſſeſſion of that maſter piece is a moſt rich poſſeſſion, no Jewell ſo pretious. It is a divine ſparke, capable of the devine nature, and fitter to be a ſanctuary and temple for God to dwell in, then to be ſo baſely uſed as it is by moſt men. They are eternal beings <hi>â parte poſt.</hi> O let me breake out, I can go no further yet; untill I have a litle wept over the ſoules of men that beſt jewell; of which men make ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count both of their owne and others. What indignity is this to abuſe this good and glorious gift of Gods goodnes, that muſt live for ever either in bliſſe or torment. Alas upon what poor termes do men hazard that, the nature and worth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is beyond mans reach to comprehend? O how cruell are men to the ſoules of one another; Do ye ſo vilifie that which God breathed into man, and ſet his owne image upon, and gave ſo great a price for, and valves above all the world beſides;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168364:54"/> But no wonder men are ſo careles of, or rather cruell unto the ſoules of others, that are ſo cruell to their owne ſoules, giving them a way in a manner for nothing, of this humour are not onely the ſcum of people, but many of the more eminent ſort; quarelling and brawling againſt the good means of grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſalvation of their poore ſoules. And imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their wit, and ſtrength, and parts, and time, and friends to maintain and defend their fleſhly luſts, which warre againſt the ſoule. O how do the moſt forget their ſoules to ſatisfie their luſts. Is it not the buſines of the world to ſatisfie their luſts, and to remove by proud violence, or cloſe fraud, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtandeth in their way. And yet to put colours and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, upon their ſoule murthering practices, to delude the world and themſelves. Beſides other goodneſſes are there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the humane nature to men, as men from a good God. Which ſhould not be ſlighted, much leſſe abuſed, ſeeing God out of his goodnes hath given them unto us. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things have we given to us, to make our life comfortable? And therefore (by the way) we ſhould be thankfull: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane and carry our ſelves ſo, at this large table which God hath given us; that it might not be a ſnare unto us, as it is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ungodly men, who make the goodnes of God an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſin, and being <hi>Waxt fat with Jeſurun, kicke and forſake God which made</hi> them, and lightly <hi>eſteem the work of their ſalvation.</hi> O tis ſad, that the good of ſtrength ſhould be an occaſion of many ſins, ſomtimes of murthers. And the good of wealth the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of pride, oppreſſion and many outrages. And the good of knowledge puffe them up that have it: and often be abuſed to fight with it againſt the trueth of God, and his wayes and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Thus do many turne the goodnes and bleſſings of God (as they are in themſelves into evill, and make them ſo many curſes. And therefore (wittily ſaith one) <hi>wicked men may have much wealth, but they have no goods.</hi> But what's all theſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that goodnes which is vouchſafed to the elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and to elect men? of both which ſorts of creatures, Chriſt is the head and Saviour; to keepe the one in the goodnes of their created eſtate: (which ſome of them kept not, <hi>The Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, Jude. ver.</hi> 6.) And to bring the other backe unto that goodnes which they had loſt. And with this goodnes Angels are a part of the myſticall body of Chriſt;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:168364:55"/> and Chriſt is the head of Angells elect, as well as of elect men. My Beloved in the Lord Jeſus. Here are goodneſſes indeed. For as no evill that can be fall the ſonnes of men is like unto that <hi>to be without Chriſt:</hi> So no goodnes comparable to this of being in the number of them that are redeemed by Chriſt Jeſus. What will pride profit, or what will the pomp of riches avail, when ye muſt loſe your ſoul. And ſuppoſe beſides your riches ye have art and learning, ſo had <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Suppoſe ye had great wiſdome, ſo had <hi>Achitophel.</hi> Suppoſe kingdoms, whoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were like thoſe of the <hi>Aſſyrians, Grecians, Perſians</hi> and <hi>Romanes.</hi> Suppoſe great knowledge in Divinitie, ſo have the very devils. The Devill is a great divine. Suppoſe morall honeſty. So had the Phariſies. Yet there muſt be another righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes to bring us to God. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.20. <hi>For I ſay unto you that except your righteouſnes ſhall exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſies, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdome of heaven.</hi>

And Firſt from this glorious diſplay of goodnes in God to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in general, to men and Angels, to more noble creatures, (yet as creatures ſimply conſidered) more ſpecially. And to elect Angels and men ſingularly, as they are members of the myſticall body of Chriſt: We may learne this, and let it ever remaine with you, that hurtfull diſpoſitions and micheivous natures, muſt needs be diſpleaſing to God. For ſuch a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and frame of ſpirit is contrary unto Gods diſpoſition: and contraries never accord well, as we ſee in this preſent world. God (ye have heard) is good to all creatures, his goodnes deſcendeth even to the feeding of yong ravens: he takes care for oxen, and doth good to his very enemies. He cauſeth his ſunne to riſe on the evill and on the good, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth raine on the juſt and on the unjuſt. And ſurely if God be ſuch a good God, as ye ſee he is: Then it muſt needs be that evill natures, and miſchievous ſpirits, and cruell diſpoſitions muſt be odious to him. As fire and water can never agree, but one muſt overcome the other, ſo will there be alwaies a quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling between God and hurting men, untill one be overcome; which (I trow) ye all ſuppoſe cannot be God. Let all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſiors and troubleſome men know, that there is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enmity between God and them. O theſe fell natures make men like unto the <hi>Devill, who like a roaring lion goeth about ſeeking

A man muſt get pikes and prongs and freathing gloves to meddle with ſome men. But God is of a ſweet and good nature. He is gratious and merciful, ſlow to anger and of great goodnes.

            <p>The Second Uſe teacheth us, that if the Lord be ſuch a ſweet God, and ſo willing, and ſo ready to do good to every body that come unto him, and are capable of his goodnes: then for us to be ſweete in our ſpeeches and words; and good and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in our carriage, ſerving our generations, and ſhewing our ſelves ready and willing to do good to all; muſt needes be pleaſing to God. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 149.4. <hi>For the Lord taketh pleaſure in his people: he will beautifie the meeke with ſalvation.</hi> We muſt needs pleaſe God in being ſweete ſpirited and uſefull to every body, for we are then like unto God: and it is a token that we feare God.

And to that end that ye may ſo be, and do, as I have ſaid; I ſhall adviſe you, Firſt, to make it your ſtudy how ye may be moſt profitable as it is ſaid of Chriſt. <hi>Math.</hi> 4.23. <hi>That he went about all Galilee teaching in their Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and preaching the Goſpel of the kingdome, and healing all manner of ſicknes, and all manner of diſeaſe among the people.</hi> And never any
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:168364:56"/> came to Chriſt, that had neede of any thing; but Jeſus Chriſt did help them and was willing to do every body good: So farre as they were capable. Tis true indeed <hi>Math.</hi> 13.58. <hi>He did not many mighty workes</hi> in his owne country, but it was; <hi>Becauſe of their unbeliefe.</hi> So farre, I ſay, as creatures were capable and willing, he went about doing all good both to ſoule and body. So I preſſe this upon you, I would have you ſtudy, which way ye may be doing moſt good. So when God ſhall take you away by death, it may be ſaid to your praiſe and honour, ther's a good man gone, there's one that a great many will finde the want of, for he was a good man, he did a great deale of good. Beloved in the Lord not they that have moſt, but they that having it, do moſt good: are the beſt men in the Pariſh and Town.

The more they hunt after reſpect, the further off ſhall they be from it, let men keepe up their credite with God, and leave God to keep up their credit with men. And therefore, if ye would be accounted the beſt men in the places where ye dwell: labour to excell in doing good, I may ſay to ſome which are diſcontented for want of that honour which they expect (for this ye know is the great quarrell of this place) as God once did to <hi>Caine, Gen.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. <hi>If thou do well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?

            <p>And this if you do, and will approve your ſelves to be good folkes: ye muſt take notice of two things under this firſt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which every good man muſt abhorre to take delight in.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:168364:57"/> For the contrary declare and plainly denominate men to be evill.</p>
            <p>Firſt ye muſt not take delight in ſinfull practiſes and courſes either your owne or others. This was that which was laid to the charge of the Gentiles <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>Who knowing the judgement of God (that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death) not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> Tis but a folly to talke of becomming good men, if ye will take delight in ſinfull courſes and in wicked mens company; keepe not company (ye that are under convictions at leaſt) with pot-companions. Tis no ſafety (ſaith one) to be neere thoſe that are under the curſe of God. O take heed of theſe coolers, they will quickly take an order with your beginings, they will quench your ſmoaking flax quickly. Ye had more need go to ſuch as will be as bellows to blow up your begun fire.</p>

Doubtles that forementioned rich man would never have beene hit in the teeth for having this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is a fruit of the ſpirit: But it was for ſome other goodneſſe, There is three ſorts of good or goodnes, Spiritual, Civill, Corporall. He was farre enough from having that which was ſpiritually good. And but litle had he of that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:168364:58"/> which was civilly or morally good. But his time and ſtrength was laid out, for theſe things that were good for the body, and as ſome uſe them, ſcarce good for that. Yet the things of this life are called by that name good, or goods, or goodneſſe: In reference to the common opinion of the world. In regard that they have an entitative goodneſſe, they are the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God; theſe he made, and he made all things good (as hath beene ſaid upon the ſecond Attribute.) And yet againe, they have not only a goodnes of entitie, but a goodnes of uſe in them; the Lord had made them very ſuteable to the needs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, affairs and buſineſſes of this life: This is that goodnes, wicked and worldly people have much of, and this is that which is meant in that place of <hi>Luke:</hi> We may likewiſe in the third place, reaſon from a command, that ſuch a goodneſſe there is to be had, and therefore it is communicable. And that it is commanded, it is evident. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>And as we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore opportunitie let us do good unto all men, &amp;c.</hi> Yea we are expreſly commanded to do good to them that are our enemies, to <hi>do good to them that hate us.</hi> Math. 5.44. Theſe precepts would not have beene, if goodnes had not beene to be had among men. As for thoſe common places objected. Firſt out of <hi>Math.</hi> 19.16.17. Where Chriſt blameth the young man for calling of him good, upon this ground, that <hi>there is none good but one, that is God.</hi> And then that in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 7.20. Where the preacher ſaith. That <hi>there is not a</hi> juſt man upon the earth, that doth good and ſinneth not. I anſwer, that underſtand the places of what kind of goodnes ye will, it muſt alway have this helpe for the making out of the ſence of them, that there is none ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly good, none perfectly good, none compleately good, but God. Yet be there ſome that have attained unto ſome good degree of goodnes, in regard whereof, they may have the title of good men. And if people would uſe the meanes and lay aſide thoſe impediments that hinder them from doing good, they might do a great deale more, and be more uſefull and beneficial; whereas now the moſt are rather like Divels then men one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another.

            <p>Now the firſt uſe that we are to make of this truth, is, to <label type="milestone">

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:168364:59"/> teach us that there is no fault in God; That men be ſo bad and miſchievous; at beſt ſo unprofitable generally. It is their owne naughty and corrupt heart, and that curſed ſelfe-love and ſecret atheiſme, and diſtruſt of God, and want of the image of Chriſt; that makes many ſuch unprofitable &amp; pernicious perſons, that do ſo much hurt in their generation. And therfore let the fault be laid where it is, and the ſadle be put upon the right horſe (as we ſay:) and let us not charge a good and gracious God, with our froward and crooked natures as too many are apt to do. Men might chuſe whether they would be ſuch (as it were) pricking and galling thornes one to another. God is good and would make men good too, if men were willing. Why do ye not ſtrive againſt the evill of your heart and labour to roote it out? And here we may note a ſad effect of Gods bounty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many that take liberty as it were by grant to be miſcheivous to others, becauſe they have more of theſe outward good things then others. As if God had delight to provide bellows to blow up unruly luſts, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.6. <hi>According to their paſture, ſo were they filled, they were filled and their heart was exalted; therfore have they forgotten me.</hi> O when the heart of men is once lifted up with the creature, they are very neere the Divells fall and frame of ſpirit.

O that this evill diſpoſition were not to be found ſo generally among us, as it is; If it were the bleſſed will of God: When God puts in good things into mens hands: The Devill is at hand to put wickednes into their hearts.

God is a giving God, he giveth to all liberally, therefore labour to be like him: and let ſuch as are groaners under their curſt, crooked, &amp; froward na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, take comfort in hope, becauſe goodnes is one of Gods communicable attributes.</p>

               </note> ſo joyned that one floweth from the other.

Now having finiſhed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of goodnes, I come to this of mercy. And in handling of it ſhall inſiſt upon the ſame three particulars firſt propounded, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That mercy (as hath beene ſaid of the reſt) is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it is a communicable attribute of God.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:168364:63"/>
            <p>Thirdly, That God in it (as in all his attributes) is infinite and incomprehenſible.</p>
            <p>To begin with the firſt of theſe propoſitions. Mercy ye ſee is attributed to God, not only here, but in many other places of Scripture <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.5. <hi>For thou Lord art good, and ready to forgive: and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee,</hi> Pſalme 106.1. <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> Pſalme 118.1. The ſame words, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 136. ye have it Sixe and twenty times: And the ſame expreſſion is in <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.11. in that prophetical promiſe of the joyfull eſtate of the Church. And one place out of the new Teſtament <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>But God which is rich in mercy,</hi> &amp;c. Mercy (ye ſee) is an attribute of God.</p>
            <p>But what is mercy? For Anſwer hereunto, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,<note place="margin">What mercy is in man?</note> that before I ſpeake of it as it is in God; I ſhould firſt of all ſhew you what it is in men. In man (therefore know) mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a vertue inciting the will to give ſuccour to anothers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and to indeavour to drive it away. In men that which is commonly reputed mercy may be a vice, ſo it may fall out. For ſuch acts as are counted mercifull, do not alwaies proceed from the ſame principle in all that it doth in ſome, which are called mercifull men. For there are ſome which give almes (as the <hi>Phariſies</hi> did) to be ſeene of men, out of vaine glory and oſtentations, which is no vertue but a vice. Or if that which is naturally a worke of mercy be done upon any other diſhoneſt ground whatſoever, or to any other unlawfull end; it then appertaines to that vice by whoſe affection it is commanded, and takes the malignitie of that ſinne (whether luſt or errour) that ſets this inclination on worke to ſuccour the miſerable. But when the end is honeſt, the worke is commanded by that vertue which hath regard to the honeſty of it, whether it be one vertue or another. VVhether it be the love of God, or love of the bretheren, or encouragement of the godly; or if it be only a pitifull diſpoſition to the creature, which is the ground thereof. The end will much denominate the action, and refer it to that errour or vice from whence ſuch a ſuppoſed act of mercy had its firſt riſe. Some that are Romiſh recuſants are ſeemingly very mercifull to the poore; perhaps it may be to draw ſuch to their religion: (As ſome Heretiques are kind and curteous, to draw others to the embracing of their opinions.)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:168364:63"/> So many likewiſe ſeem to be very forward to do good, when it may be to ſerve their luſts of coveteouſneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pride and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe. Such actions as theſe cannot be called mercifull or good: but muſt be referred to that vice which is the ground of them. If one ſhould tempt a poore man to ſteale upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his poverty, or perſwade one that is ſick to go to Charmers or white Witches for the recovering of health: theſe actions could not be mercifull, but rather muſt be referred to the head of cruelty, to the poore ſoules of ſuch perſons ſo tempted ſo perſwaded and adviſed.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it pleaſeth the ſpirit of God in Scripture to uſe termes and words promiſcuouſly ſometimes in predications both of God and men;<note place="margin">Whether mercy be in men a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct vertue from goodneſse and love,</note> and even about the attribute of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes lately handled, and this of mercy now in hand; one word doth ſignifie either thing, mercy ſometimes being uſed for goodnes, and goodnes put to ſignifie mercy: it will be worth our inquiry a little to ſee what the difference is between theſe two vertues, and alſo that of love which is often taken to be the ſame with goodnes and mercy. As to make this appeare to be ſo I remember a paſſage in Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> his ſoule conflict Page 446. touching love, goodnes and mercy in God, which I will relate. <hi>It is good to ſee bleſſings as they iſſue from grace and mercy, it much commends any bleſſing to ſee the love and favour of God in it.</hi> In thoſe words ye ſee he puts a difference betweene bleſſings (which I take to be the ſame with good things beſtowed) and mercy, and grace, and the love and favour of God: and yet all theſe foure laſt words are uſed for one and the ſame thing; which in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced an artiſt is to be taken notice of. As if mercy and love were one and the ſame thing. And yet in many places of Scripture, we find goodnes &amp; mercy taken in the ſame ſenſe, &amp; mercy and love ſomtimes diſtinguiſhed, for ſatisfaction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and clearing of this difficultie, we muſt know: that if we reſtraine the word mercy to his proper ſignification, according to the etymon of the word &amp; the definition of the vertue; to wit to rid one out of a notable diſtreſs or miſery from an aflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; compaſſionate heart towards him: then mercy hath a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower object then goodnes or love. But yet becauſe uſually ſuch workes as we call workes of mercy, proceed from the affection of love, and that love which we call the love of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:168364:64"/> good will towards our neighbour, doth in a ſort wholly live in workes of mercy (for the love of complacency is of another nature) I ſay for this cauſe: love mercy and goodnes are ſometimes uſed to ſignifie one and the ſame readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to do good to all, or help any, and to be of a loving deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Howſoever therefore there may be uſe of deſtinctions ſometimes, to wit, when we ſpeake particularly of them as vertues in men, or graces in ſaints, or attributes in God: yet in ordinary popular diſcourſe they come all to one, and ſo are uſed by the Holy Ghoſt oftentimes in Scripture, in paſſages both concerning God and alſo men.</p>
            <p>But that nothing may be left unſaid to give full ſatisfaction, I will give you diſtinct definitions of theſe three, goodnes or benignity, love of goodwill, and mercy as they are attributed to God, and found in men.</p>
            <p>Goodnes is the will of God, whereby he is inclined to do good to creatures and the effects thereof</p>
            <p>Love is the will of God approving what in his creatures is good and agreeable to his holy mind and manifeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry effects thereof.</p>
            <p>Mercy is the will of God whereby he is inclined to ſuccour ſuch as are in miſery and the manifeſtation of it in acts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. In men, goodnes or benignitie is a diſpoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make the lives of creatures comfortable,<note place="margin">Amore nihil eſt aliud qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bonum velle amata.</note> by afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that may any way conduce thereunto. And love is a certaine propenſion of the appetite concupiſcible unto what is accounted good and fit, for him that loveth and a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of good will and friendſhip upon occaſion both in word and deede to ſuch objects. And mercy ſaid <hi>Philoſophers</hi> is a ſicknes of mind conceived from the miſery of another ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up to ſhew pity and compaſſion and to ſuccour ſuch a one. But laſtly in ſaints theſe come to be graces, and ſo acceptable to God, being fruits of the ſpirit, tending to God, and having reſpect to him. So we are full of goodnes towards the bodies and ſoules of others, communicating what we have for their good and benefitt. Shewing love for Gods ſake in both word and deed even to them that wrong us and abuſe us. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bowels of mercy towards all that be in miſery, and being ready to do any thing for their ſuccour. Now of all theſe three

               </note> we are to ſpeake of mercy now as it is to him attributed.</p>
            <p>One thing is very neceſſary to be premiſed in this diſcourſe, to wit that mercy in God, is not as it is defin'd by Philoſophers (as hath beene before hinted) A ſicknes of mind conceived from the miſery of another. For ſadnes and afliction of mind cannot be in God, though in Scripture there are ſuch meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors uſed. But mercy in God is his very eſſence whereby he is infinitely diſpoſed to helpe ſuccour and comfort ſuch as be in any miſerable condition. Thoſe expreſſions in Scripture. <hi>In their afflictions he was afflicted. And mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</hi> Are borrowed Phraſes. As from the turning of the bowells in men at the fight of an object of pitty. And yet in men this is not mercy it ſelfe, but a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of pitty. Yet becauſe by it our mercy is made known, we call it by the name of mercy. We call rowling of bowells mercy, and mercy rowling of bowells, which yet is but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of it, and that in men only and not in God. Mercy may be without it, and in God allwaies is; becauſe God hath no bowels to be turned, God is one moſt ſimple eſſence, and hath no qualities. And therefore when we ſay God is merciful, we ſpeak of him metaphorically, as when we ſay God is angry. Anger is a turbulency of ſpirit, but there is no ſuch thing in God. The effects of that which is called anger in God, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put for ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> In like manner when we ſee the rod taken of and caſt into the fire (which is an effect of mercy) we ſay God is mercifull. But mercy in God ſignifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt an inclination in his heavenly Majeſty to ſhew mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly the effects of his ſuppoſed affection, which is his helping of the miſerable creature, or a making out of God to ſuch as have need of helpe and pitty. The affection of mercy in men is knowne by that griefe that accompanies it,<note place="margin">Tanquam à nobis notiori vertus ipſa no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men traxit.</note> but ſuch a companion of mercy cannot be in God. O mercy is a glorious attribute of God, he is a very ſea of mercy, he is never dry. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men he that is fulleſt of pitty is but a drop of it. Their pitty falls infinitly ſhort of what is in God.</p>
            <p>And this mercy of God is either generall to all his creatures
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:168364:65"/> or ſpeciall unto mankind or more ſpeciall and peculiar, that whereby he is ſaid to be mercifull to his elect unto eternall life, and freedom from the wrath to come. Let us view the generall mercy of God to all his creatures. Three things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to be looked upon.</p>
            <p>Firſt the raiſing up of all creatures out of nothing. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The extenſion of tender mercies of providence towards all creatures wraped up in miſery, of which ſee <hi>Pſalme</hi> 145.9. <hi>The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his workes. His mercy is over and upon all his workes, as the warmth of the hen is over all the eggs, to warm, and cheriſh, and nouriſh them, ſo Gods mercy is over all his works,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>to cheriſh and nouriſh, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, that is, it is ſhewed forth upon them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, When creatures be in deſtreſſe and cry in their kind, God heares them and relieves them. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 147.9. <hi>He giveth to the beaſt his food: and to the young Ravens which cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next for ſpeciall mercies towards men. As he hath raiſed them with other creatures out of nothing; ſo he hath lifted up in the creation humanitie to a ſupernaturall life. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe two acts of God may more properly be referred to the goodnes of God: yet ſurely his proviſion made of other creatures for their ſervice, and his relieving their miſeries with ſupplies; makes it appeare, <hi>that</hi> out of his mercy <hi>he is the Saviour of all men,</hi> though <hi>eſpecially of them that beleeve.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. But now for this ſingular mercies to his Church, beſides thoſe in which they are in commons with all other men and creatures: whereof (with a little helpe) the reparation of that whole kind may go for one of the common ones. <hi>God hath ſhewed his mercy in giving a Saviour to mankinde,</hi> faith Mr. <hi>Perkines,</hi> Marke I pray, <hi>to mankind.</hi> And John 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he ſent his only begotten Sonne, &amp;c,</hi> I ſay beſides this, he ſhews his mercy to his Church and people, in delivering them from the curſe, and giving them the means of ſalvation, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing them ſecure of remiſſion of ſinnes here, and life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting hereafter. But that theſe mercies of the Lord may not paſſe ſo: I ſhall here faſten a while, to ſpeak of the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of loſt man fallen in <hi>Adam</hi> unto ſinne and naturall miſeries, and liable by this fall to eternall death. The raiſing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:168364:65"/> of them up, and the underpropping of them with greater helps then before; ſure here abundant goodnes and mercy doth ſhine out very gloriouſly. Here we may by the way ſpeake of thoſe ſeverall kindes of mercy which ſome have obſerved to be in God, and ſo we ſhall next come unto the branches of that mercy, which is the great mercy of all towards ſuch of the faln race of <hi>Adam,</hi> as by Chriſt are raiſed up to enjoy everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>The mercies of God extended in this life may be reduced to five heads.<note place="margin">There is a five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mercy of God.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Firſt whereof, is rewarding mercy, This is when ſuch as do well, though they do ill alſo (as who liveth and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſinneth not?) are rewarded: <hi>Mercy rejoyceth againſt judgement,</hi> James 2.13. And God paſſeth by what is done amiſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth what is well done. He doth good to his ſervants that feare him, and forgetteth not their works of faith and labour of love and actions of obedience, but of his mercy rewardeth them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He hath alſo pardoning mercy. As he <hi>crowneth with loving kindneſſe and tender mercies.</hi> Pſalm 103.4. So <hi>he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> iniquities</hi> ver. the third of the ſame <hi>Pſalme.</hi> This is that mercy which <hi>David</hi> prayeth for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.7. <hi>Remember not the ſinns of my youth nor my tranſgreſſions: according to thy mercy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou me, for thy goodnes ſake O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, God alſo hath prevaling mercy, when he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us from thoſe evills either of ſinne or puniſhment that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſeeth we are running into. So ſometimes when the Lord ſees his ſervants haſtening to the committing of ſinne, which will certainly bring ſorrow upon us; he hindereth and preventeth the doing of theſe things. And ſo when wicked men plot to bring miſery on the people of God: as <hi>Haman</hi> did concerning the Jews in <hi>Eſter,</hi> God hinders it. So when more then forty had bound themſelves under a curſe, neither to eate nor drink till they had killed <hi>Paul</hi> Acts 23. God prevents it by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the ſtory is obvious. This is Gods preventing mercy, to keep us from ſinne; and ſo from the puniſhment due for ſinne, and from the Conſpiracies of evill men:</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God ſometimes ſheweth mercy in delivering his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> people out of ſinne, and from afflictions and ſorrows lying
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:168364:66"/> on them for ſinne. Though he ſometimes let them fall into the evill of ſinne or puniſhment; yet he is pleaſed to helpe up and take them out againe. This is another mercifull diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God. There cannot be greater objects of pity then men and women that go on in ſinne. God comes and ſees ſuch and raiſeth ſome up out of that gulfe, in which thouſands do yet lye, that never met with this mercifull hand of God to help them out. In this ſence, <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi> Rom. 9.15. And therefore it is a great mercy of God to give men grace to repent of their ſinnes, and not to let them ly ſtill in them. And doubtles ſuch as the Lord loves, he will one way or another fetch them off from their ſinfull courſes. He will do as kind and wiſe fathers do with their diſobedient children, he will double and treble his fatherly ſtrokes on us untill he amends us, and make us ſtoop under him, and bring us off from our miſcarriages. God permitted <hi>David</hi> to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a woefull gulfe of ſinne; but here was his great mercy ſeene in helping him out again. And ſo for <hi>Peter,</hi> how did he thrice fall moſt fearfully into that great ſinne of denying his maſter, &amp;c. But in mercy he was holpen out again, he had grace to go forth and weepe bitterly, and recovered himſelfe a gain in the Church of God, in regard of this eſteeme and reputation. And ſo alſo it is true for grievous troubles, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.19. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, There is exerciſed by God, ſparing mercy. This the Church prayes for often in Scripture. This God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to his people.<note place="margin">Foure degrees of ſparing mercy in God.</note> And ſhews it many and diverſe waies. Sometimes by not puniſhing at all, ſomtimes by deferring pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Sometimes by moderating his corrections, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſometimes in the very act of afflicting his people for ſinne, he ſhewes a ſparing ſpirit,<note place="margin">Mal. 3·17.</note> a mercifull diſpoſition, manifeſting how unwilling he is to do what he doth, but that needs he muſt</p>
            <p>Of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en God paſſeth by the ſinnes of his people, and doth not reckon with them at all for them: <hi>As a father ſpareth his Sonne that ſerveth him,</hi> even when <hi>the day commeth that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud and all that do wickedly ſhall be ſtubble, &amp;c.</hi> Mal. 4.1. which is to be underſtood of ſome generall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:168364:66"/> that are upon the earth, then God packs up his jewells and ſpareth them in that day. Here is an alluſion to men that have their houſes burning, who do not regard their lumber, their timber ſtuffe: but looke to their chiefe writings, coyn and jewels, to preſerve them. So God in common calamities hath a mercifull eye towards and hand over his beloved ones; yea ſometimes for the ſake of them he ſaveth, ſuch as are neare and deare unto them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.29. <hi>And it came to paſſe when God deſtroyed the cityes of the plaine, that God remembred</hi> Abraham, <hi>and ſent</hi> Lot <hi>out of the middeſt of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which</hi> Lot <hi>dwelt.</hi> So this is one particular in which is ſeene Gods ſparing mercy. When God hides his people in times of indignation. And alſo when he forgets their ſinne and caſteth them behind his back, and doth not puniſh at all. Theſe phraſes of paſſing by, and not paſſing by are uſuall in Scripture, and to ſet forth the mercy of God, in this head of ſparing mercy as one breach thereof.</p>
            <p>So alſo Gods adjourning his puniſhments to a farther day,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his ſuffring his Spirit to ſtrive with men, as he did with the old world. <hi>The long ſuffring of God waited in the daies of</hi> Noah <hi>while the Ark was a preparing.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.20. When God was provoked by their ſinns, yet he waited one hundred and twenty yeeres. This deferrings of judgment is a branch of that ſparing mercy of God which we live under. But Sirs, the glaſſe is running all this while, &amp; there is an appointed time for every purpoſe. The time appointed will be expired, and though God may ſeem to have leaden feet: yet be ſure he will have Iron hands at laſt: Though he come ſlowly he will ſmite ſurely: O Do not be bold in ſin, God is merciful to forbear, to put off &amp; defer his plagues but it will not be wiſdom for you to defer to put off your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>His ſpirit will not alway ſtrive.</hi> He will be paid for forbearance, ye will be left altogether in excuſable if his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance work not at all with you.</p>
            <p>And as if the Lord did ſtudy to be mercifull in his dealing towards the ſons of men: what moderations and rebates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doth he ſhew in his puniſhments, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 78.38. <hi>But he being full of compaſſion forgave their iniquitie and deſtroyed them not:</hi> but of this branch we have ſpoken already. Marke therefore what followes, <hi>yea many a time turned he his anger away.</hi> Here is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168364:67"/> branch of ſparing mercy; but yet further, <hi>and did not ſtirre up all his</hi> wrath. Here ye have all three in one verſe. But that which we have now in hand, is the moderation that is in this God of judgment; when he muſt needs puniſh, he doth it <hi>in judgment not in fury.</hi> He doth <hi>not make a full end, but correct in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> even when he doth <hi>not leave</hi> his people <hi>altogether unpuniſhed</hi> Jer. 46.28. Lament. 3.22. <hi>It is of the Lords mercy that we are not utterly conſumed.</hi> To wit, his ſparing mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, upon this point or branch of ſparing mercy, it is noted by ſome, that God doth ſomtimes ſhew a kind of unwillingnes and loathnes to lay on ſtripes on the backs of his ſervants. He doth not take delight in the putting of his ſervants to paine. He doth not laugh at their calamitie. But he is brought in groaning while he is whipping, as a father correcting with weeping eies. <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give the up</hi> Ephraim, <hi>how ſhall I deceive thee</hi> Iſrael? <hi>how ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>how ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>mine heart is turned within me, my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are kindled together.</hi> Here is a conflict (as it were in the very ſpirit of God. O how ſhall I do it? O what a ſparing heart the Lord hath towards the ſons of men? Where he muſt needs corect them, it is much againſt his will. Truly he never dealt with Chriſt ſo as he doth with the ſons of men. He ſpareth not him in any regard at all. He ſpared him not in the firſt way, he tooke not away the puniſhment, but he gave him up to death. The cup did not paſſe away but it was drunk. Neither was it deferred, but when the houre was come he ſuffered, he was ſacrificed in the time ſet for it. And that without mitigation. He had not one drop taken out of this bitter cup. Neither was there any relunctancy in God againſt it. He did not weepe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him when he was ſuffring, He never cryed how ſhould I ſuffer thee my ſonne to dye? How ſhould I endure to ſee thee ſo uſed? But it pleaſed the father. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10. <hi>yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him.</hi> He had not only voluntatem but voluptatem. He did as it were harden his heart upon him, which made him cry, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> I Tell you ſirs, there was great reaſon, why God ſhould not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168364:67"/> ſpare Chriſt, Though he ſpare us continually.</p>
            <p>For. Firſt it delighted God to ſee his juſtice ſatisfied,<note place="margin">Reaſons why God ſpared not Chriſt.</note> he would have a full ſatisfaction to it, It was expedient that all the mercy ſhould be towards the redeemed and none towards the redeemer. As Chriſt ſtood in our ſteede he was to ſatisfie juſtice, and ſo to have what he paid for. Thus juſtice is exact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d which God could not indure ſhould be trampled under foot. This muſt needes be a pleaſant ſight in Gods eyes. That we ſinners might have all mercy, he that ſaved us from our ſinnes had no mercy. Sparing mercy is the loweſt degree of mercy, yet this was denyed to Chriſt, that he might pay every ſort of mercy for us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He knew what his ſonne could do. He laughed at the triall of him, becauſe he knew he would do well enough. It pleaſed the Father to ſee his ſonne tug with death ſo, and all ſorrows, even as a Generall takes delight to ſee his ſouldiers play the men bravely. But I am ſenſible of a digreſſion and therefore returne to the matter in hand: that mercy of all kinds is in God. Ye have had a diſcourſe of a fivefold mercy. And now next I am to ſpeake (as I promiſed) of that great manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of mercy to mankind, fallen from his good eſtate. I meane to the remnant elect, to the little flocke: for whoſe ſake glorious doings and marveilous tranſactions have beene in the world. For to the end, that man ſo fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo miſerable every way (as hath been heretofore ſhewed:) might be raiſed up and freed from all ſorts of ſorrows and deaths; from griefe here and from eternall damnation hereafter: and be made fit to enjoy grace &amp; mercy here, and glory eternal in the heavens: God hath diverſe and ſundry waies ſhewed his abundant goodnes and mercy as ſhall now be declared.</p>
            <p>And,<note place="margin">Effects and acts of mercy.</note> Firſt let us begin with the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt the eternall Sonne of God. In this God hath declared his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love and mercy to us.

               </gap>y read <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten ſonne: that whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Who conſidering this in his minde can chuſe but be aſtoniſhed? who can hold teares in the conſideration of ſo great mercy? That God would ſend his Sonne out of his owne boſome, even him <hi>who thought it not

               <note place="margin">Phillip. 2.6. <hi>ver.</hi> 7.</note> to be made <hi>of no reputation</hi> and <hi>to take upon him the forme of a ſervant</hi> and <hi>to be made in the likeneſſe of men.</hi> Rather then man ſhould be utterly loſt. That he (I ſay) of infinite majeſty with the father and Holy Spirit, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; who created all things, whom ſo many millions of Angles ſerve, and who in a moment of time is able of nothing, to create infinit other more excellent then men to worſhip him: ſhould be borne in a ſtable, laid in a mangre; that man, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, the loweſt of rationall nature, next of kind to the bruite beaſts, addicted to earthly things, void of heavenly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, unthankfull, rebellious, in whom there was nothing worthy of love, many things worthy of hatred, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Should be freed from everlaſting damnation, and raigne eternally with God in glory. Here is a rare effect and fruit of mercy indeed! If a man riding a long the high way, ſhould find a poor raged louzy wretch almoſt dead groveling and wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in blood and dirt; and beholding this wofull ſight, ſhould alight from his horſe, and take up this poore creature, carry it upon his back or in his arme to ſome houſe, and take all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible care for its waſhing, dreſſing and recovery: and in the meane time have his horſe ſtollen by thieves, himſelfe perſuing beaten and wounded; ſhould yet rejoice that he hath ſaved the life of the poore creature: would not ſuch a man be noted for a good man, a mercifull man? Beloved bretheren, this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of what Jeſus Chriſt hath done for us. He did lay aſide his glory, and tooke part with our (even with the worſt) miſeries; and all in mercy to deliver us from hell, and to bring us to glory. Stand amazed O ye ſons of men! If ye did but conſider what ignorance of God, athiſme, brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and helliſh cruelties are in Chriſtendom (and ye muſt think there is much more out of it) ye would conclude that the world is in a moſt miſerable condition, being God is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; And therefore to do as hath beene a little ſaid for the ſalvation of ſuch, muſt needs proceed from unſpeakable mercy even the mercy of a God. To this head is to be referred the bitter paſſion of our bleſſed Saviour. His nakednes and poverty, his hunger and thirſt, his labours and hardſhips of life, his reproaches and perſecutions, his buffetings and ſpittings, his whipings, and prickings of thornes, his agony and bloody
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:168364:68"/> ſweat; all kindes of opprobies and dolorous ſufferings even unto the accurſed death of the croſſe. And this is the firſt effect of Gods mercy, Chriſt Incarnation.</p>
            <p>Behold next the revelation of the mind of God by this Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Jeſus Chriſt ſo Incarnated. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1.2. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in diverſe manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the fathers by by the prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken to us by his ſonne.</hi>

Then it muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other rare fruit of mercy, to ignorant, blind, ſotiſh, brutiſh, mankind to have ſuch a glorious Sunne to ſhine, that people that ſit in darknes and in the ſhadow of death, may have their feet guided into the wayes of peace and ſalvation. And truly herein, Engliſh men have a great ſhare in this mercy, that when ſo many places in the world are without the ſound and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcoveries of the Goſpel: have ſuch as no nation under heaven doth (or ever did) goe beyond us, ſcarce any, (ſurely very few) ever enjoyed the like. But that we may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what taken with his effect of mercy, let us looke into it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further by the conſideration of two things about it.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The condition the world was in when Chriſt came.</note> The condition that the world was in when Chriſt came, and then his comming and behaviour for the enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. For the firſt, the whole world except a very few was ignorant of Chriſt, and of its maker: of divine providence and the government of the world, of the end of good and evill, to wit, eternall life, and eternal death, heaven and hell. How few then, (and yet indeed) tooke notice of the ſoules immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, the evill of ſinne both in regard of his wages and work, ſorrow &amp; deformity, the worth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beauty of exact walking. The devill the Prince of darkneſſe being the God of this dark world, held all (as he doth the greateſt part to this very day) under his government and diſcipline; behold deadly darknes was upon the face of the whole earth, incomparably worſe then the darkneſſe that was in Aegypt mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.21. All their beauty was deformity, their potency, wealth, and eloquence with which they flouriſhed, were of no worth, becauſe of no efficacy to the obtaining of eternall life or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from hell. Now in this miſery and blindnes in which the whole world in a manner lay, The Lord Jeſus moved with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:168364:69"/> mercy and pity came into this dark and blind world, &amp; diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led theſe darkneſſes with his diſcovery of the mind of his father. He detects errors, opens the frauds &amp; tyrany of the Devil, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the world, and ſhews them the author of all things, his power, providence, mercy &amp; juſtice, the reward of good men in graffed into Chriſt, and the puniſhment everlaſting prepared for ungodly men and unbelievers. This light ſhone three yeers and halfe in the perſon of the ſon of God in the fleſh, in diverſe townes and villages, in the wilderneſſe, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The excellency of this light, it contained nothing but what was profitable to ſalvation, for the manner it was plane and familiar, that all might be capable of it. It was pure and perfect, enlightning the underſtanding, reforming the ſoule excluding ſinfullnes and iniquity, directing in piety righteouſneſſe and ſobriety, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the whole life, and conforming the whole man within and without, to the divine will and eternall love of the moſt holy God. This was done by Chriſt in the fleſh, his humanity was the inſtrument made uſe of in the adminiſtration of the Goſpel of ſalvation. And therefore nothing can be deſired for matter or manner that is wanting, this myſtery of ſalvation coming out of ſo good a hand. The very particulars inſiſted on by Chriſt in his ſermons, have in them ſublimatie and beauty. He commandeth ſelfe-deniall, the renouncing of all the world for his ſake, a patient taking up of the croſſe, the love of our enemies,<note place="margin">The Lords prayer not to be uſed as a charme but to be ſtudied as a text. <hi>Math. 13.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And that is the giving of this our Saviour to be (as it were) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a Coppy for all good life: the very living and walking law of the moſt high God. A compendium of all thoſe morrals that ever were in the mind of God to be done, even from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Learne of me ſaith Chriſt. Would ye live exactly?
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:168364:69"/> learne of Chriſt. Be zealous as he was zealous. The zeal of Gods houſe did even eat him up, <hi>John</hi> 2.17. <hi>And his Diſciples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that it was written, the zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up:</hi> you know it was upon his driving the buyers &amp; ſellers out of the Temple; Be meeke and lowly as he was, he bids you learne of him, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.29. We muſt learne both of theſe: Many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be zealous, as Chriſt was, but they have not his meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And ſo ſome pretend to write after his meekeneſſe, but want zeale: But we muſt looke upon Chriſt and imitate him in doing the whole will of his Father. Demonſtration and practice is an excellent way of teaching: Now Chriſt doth not only teach us what to do, but he doth it before us. There is ſcarſe any particular duty that God requires, but we have a preſident in Chriſt, a ſampler to work by: As for children that have a precept, to honour their parents, you know in Chriſt they have a patterne, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.51. And he went downe with them and came to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and was ſubject unto them. And ſo for obedience to magiſtrates: And ſo for ſuffring in the cauſe of truth and religion, he was as a lambe dumbe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſhearer: And ſo alſo for the Church, he made no ſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſme or rent. He was circumciſed, went unto the feaſts, joyned in publicke worſhip, and did not rent himſelfe from the Jewiſh Church; though it laboured under many corruptions. And therefore have a care, how ye ſlight any thing, that ye ſee Chriſt was ready to performe: What can ye wiſh to have a warrant for, that ye may not find in this Coppy? Modeſty, Gravity, Sobriety, Affability, circumſpection in words and deeds, benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, compaſſion, mercy, conformity to order, devotion, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, any thing, every thing that is required in the holy law of God. We have many vaine talkers, whoſe mouth muſt be ſtopped, becauſe they are evill doers, as well as vaine talkers. This is a rare effect of Mercy in God, who well knew that our eies are more upon examples, then our eares attent to precepts: and therefore hath provided a notable one for us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another effect of mercy is freedom from ſinne, divers waies; for Firſt, though we are not free from being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſinners; yet we are free and exempted from having the guilt of ſinne charg'd upon us. O how ſweete is this unto ſuch as ly under the ſenſe of ſinne. And Secondly, freed we are by the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:168364:70"/> mercifull hand of God, from ſinning with a full and free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of will. In this ſence is it ſaid 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is borne of God, doth not commit ſinne.</hi> It is true alſo, that if any man ſay he <hi>hath no ſinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>he deceiveth himſelfe, and the truth is not in him.</hi> This therefore is to be underſtood of liking ſinne and lying in ſinne.<note place="margin">Peccatum quod repugnat divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae bonitati eſt ſummum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</note> But behold this great mercy of God towards us, that whereas ſinne, which is the greateſt evill, becauſe it is contrary to Gods goodnes and holines, and calleth for eternall ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and likewiſe containeth in it unſpeakable deformitie and ſinfulnes: A juſt ſatisfaction is given in the divine perſon of the Son of God; and in mercy alſo the ſeeds are ſown of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frame of ſpirit in all that ſhall be ſaved. Whence comes a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> fifth effect and gift of mercy to wit, Freedome from eternall death and deſtruction, and a reſcuing us from the gulfe of that bottomleſſe Barathrum, a freeing us from fiery Tophet. <hi>The wages of ſinne is death, but the gift of God is eternal life:</hi> (of which particular I will ſpeak,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> when I come to it: But now behold, mercy in delivering us from ſo great a death: Do but believe that what the Scriptures ſay of hell fire is true; and ye muſt needs ſay that to be freed from that place or ſtate, muſt needs be an unſpeakable, yea an inconceivable mercy. O when a man can ſay though I muſt dy, yet I ſhall not be damned; Though the pit of the grave ſhut her mouth upon me, yet the pit of hell is by mercy ſhut againſt me; what an unſpeakable mercy is this?

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, Proceede we to the grace of adoption whereby we
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:168364:70"/> are become the very ſons and daughters of this mercifull God.<note place="margin">Adoptio eſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctus benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium à condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione peccati</note> This is deſtinct from the former. For as when a Prince that hath pardoned a Malefactor and given him his life, ſhall not content himſelfe therewith, but beſides pardoning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury freeing from the puniſhment, bloting out the infamy; ſhall alſo take ſuch a one to be his ſonne, and give him right and power to raign; this would tend much to the declaration of his noble mercy: So is it with us in this effect of mercy; We ſhall not only be freed from wrath, but be taken into Gods family. Now to the further conſideration of this adoption of ſonnes, foure things would be looked upon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The ſtate God hath taken us from.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſtate to which he hath brought us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The good which thereupon we do expect.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The meanes whereby this is effected: We were enemies, unworthy of the leſt mercy, and liable to everlaſting ſorrowes. But are advanced to union unto and communion with Chriſt: Not to a moderate or mean eſtate of hapines of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes or angelical happines natural. But to be the ſons of God, the ſons of the eternal King, the heires of God, and Coheires of Chriſt, conſorts of divine glory, &amp; partakers of all divine good things with him, we are made one with Chriſt not in conceit or imagination only; for this conjunction is in truth a reall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. The prayer of Chriſt is,<note place="margin">John 17.22.</note> 
               <hi>That all beleevers may be one with him, as he is one with the Father,</hi> viz. by one and the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwelling in Chriſt and in all members of Chriſt; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.24. <hi>And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the ſpirit which he hath given us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Perkins on the third to the Galatians Page 265. ſaith. All the Saints in heaven and all beleevers upon earth, having one and the ſame ſpirit of Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, are all one in Chriſt.</note> Not as if Chriſt and Saints were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſons, or as if the properties of the Godhead or qualities of his manhood were transformed into us; or as if we were only by a bare conſent (as freinds are) one, or as, if Chriſt and all the Saints were one ſubſtance. I ſay none of theſe waies are we one with Chriſt. But as all the Members of the body naturall have one ſoule: So have all the Saints with Chriſt their head, owne ſpirit. And this comes to paſſe on Gods part by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull donation, and on our part by faithfull reception. Thus we ſee how we are one with Chriſt, and ſo by conſequence do poſſeſſe Chriſt, and injoy him and his benefits: partly in this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:168364:71"/> life and fully in the life to come. So that from our adoption, we looke for ſuch good, ſo great joy, ſo much glory, as <hi>eie hath not ſeene nor eare heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man.</hi> O what a gulfe of diſtance is there betweene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that eſtate from which we are taken,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> and that whereunto we are brought: And the meanes whereby all this commeth to paſſe ye have heard already, is the ſonne of man. For firſt, one man is taken to be Gods naturall ſon, the fullnes of the God-head being ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially united to him; By this man Chriſt Jeſus, God adopteth and maketh his ſonnes,<note place="margin">Eodem ſpiritu vivunt (nimirum membra Chriſti) quo Deus ipſe, &amp; quo Chriſtus filius Dei naturalis vivit, et ſi hic ſpiritus diverſo modo iſtis communicetur: perſonis enim divinis communicator per identita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, idque vel immediata neceſſitate, ut patri; vel per aeternam generationem aut ſpirationem, ut filio &amp; ſpiritui ſancto: huminitati verò Chriſti perhypoſtalicam vnionem, nobis per quandam extenſionem qua mediante dono gratiae juſtificantis incipit eſſe noſter ſpiritus, noſtra vita, nos inhabitans, ornans, movens ergens, &amp; omnes vitales functiones Deo platen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in nobis excitans &amp; edens.

And according to this priviledge of Adoption, are we and all our weake en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors looked upon &amp; eſteemed. <hi>O behold what manner of love the father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sonnes of God.</hi> 1 John. 3.1.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, We have the benefit of all Chriſts merits: All that Chriſt ever did or ſuffered is made over to us, and we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in him, without blame in the ſight of God. From mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it is ſo ordred and brought about, that Chriſt did the work, but we receive the wages, Chriſt bore the Croſſe, but we weare the Crown. Beloved, we have the benefit of all Chriſts merits. So that what Chriſt merited, we are ſaid to merit by meanes of our union that we have with him. We are alwaies hereby in a capacity of pardon, as often as we ſinne and by true repentance turne unto God. What Prince was ever ſo mercifull as to be in readineſſe to pardon ſuch as capitally offend or commit high treaſon every day? But our God of his mercy is ready every minuit to pardon the ſinnes of his people. For, <hi>if any man ſin we have an advocate with the Father, &amp;c.</hi> 1 John 2.1. Here is a moſt rich treaſury, here are merits that can never be Drawne out. It is impoſſible ſo many ſinnes ſhould ever be committed as might be beyond the riches and worth of them.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:168364:71"/>
            <p>Yet we muſt know that the worth of them is not drunke up by us,<note place="margin">Quicquid reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur recipitur ad modum recipientis</note> for we are not able ſo to receive them to our uſe as they are in Chriſt. For not in the like meaſure is the ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all that are juſtified. Although each Saint hath the whole ſpirit, yet not in an equall manner and meaſure. And ſo although each Saint hath whole Chriſt made over to him withall his merits; yet there is not one that hath ſins enough to take him up holy by appropriation or to make a full propro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between their miſery and his merits: but ſtill there will be overflowings of the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Mercy cauſeth the powering out of the ſpirit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> grace. By vertue of our union, we do <hi>of his fullnes receive,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.16.</note> 
               <hi>and grace for grace.</hi> So that as a litle child is anſwerable in every part to the talleſt and ſtouteſt man, ſo the little meaſure of graces in the weakeſt Saints have a conformitie to the graces that are in Chriſt, though the difference in regard of degrees be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great. There is wiſdome, patience, meekenes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which God gives out and adornes his choſen ones withall. Never did a Queene preſent her ſelfe ſo beautiful in the eyes of the greateſt Monarck; as the Church the Spouſe of Chriſt is rendred lovely in the eyes of God. Salomon Song. cap. 7.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are thy feet with ſhoes, O Princes Daughter? Ye may at leaſure read when ye pleaſe the reſt. But ſuch as are proud, ſcornfull, paſſionate, intemperate, covetous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God ſhould take pleaſure or delight in them. O how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull is the ſpirits work upon the ſoule? a ſoft heart, an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient will, and the gifts of ſaving and ſanctifying grace. A man in the ſtate of nature (ſaith one) is like a pond full of toads, a man in the ſtate of grace is a paradiſe of God. Beautifull in Gods eies is a gratious ſoule from top to toe. O ye that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the mire and dirt and filth of ſinne, do ye thinke God can take pleaſure in ſuch as ye be? But Gods people are made comely by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, From the mercy of God in Chriſt, the people of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> come to have the ſweetenes of ordinances while others mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on a brown dry cruſt, or on a chew'd gobbet that hath no ſweetnes at all left in it. Formall and Carnall Chriſtians have an egge-ſhell but no yolke, an nutſhell but no kernell, they heare good wordes of God, but never taſted that the Lord was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:168364:72"/> gratious and mercifull. The Saints upon whom the mercy of God is deſcended find ſweetenes in all religious exerciſes and holy ordinances. They have the ſweetenes of prayer, preaching, reading, conference: and when they come to break bread with the Church,<note place="margin">Mendicato hic pane vivamus annum hoc pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrem ſacritur in eo quod paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimer pane cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> angelis, <hi>&amp;c. Luth. in Pſ.</hi> Burroughs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes choice. Pſal. <hi>36.7, 8.</hi>
               </note> they are made to be in the ſweete ſence of their neer relation to Jeſus Chriſt, they are in the ſpirit on the Lords day. Ordinances are like that ſealed booke we read of in the Revelation, c. 5.1. <hi>Iohn</hi> wept becauſe no man was found to open it and read it. But for them that are in Chriſt, mercy hath better provided. The ſeales are taken away, the booke is opened, the nutts are brokened the kernels are to be eaten, which are very ſweete. O tis a bleſſing and full of ſweetenes to be joyned in union and communion with the people of God. Though we beg our bread, ſayes <hi>Luther,</hi> is it not made up with this, that we are fed with the bread of angels, with eternal life Chriſt, and the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is certaine the ſervants of God find ſuch comfort in theſe preſcribed practiſes, that they would not for any good be bereft of them. Neither can they poſſibly free themſelves from the guilt of prophaneſſe that do not highly prize and heartily rejoyce in theſe things. Such as do believe themſelves, to be members of Chriſts body, muſt needes deſire thoſe ordinances that he hath appointed for the building of it up, and do find thriving in grace and comfort in ſpirit farre beyond any creature comforts. Here they meete with rivers of pleaſures. <hi>And thou</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>ſhall make them drinke of the river of thy pleaſure,</hi> to wit in ordinances.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Tenthly all particular vouchſafements come to the ſervants of God as a fruit and effect of mercy. Somtimes they have more of this worlds goods then ever they expected, and grace with all to uſe what they have to the glory of God: and this makes their enjoyments mercys. Many are crying and wiſhing every where, for wealth and riches, and outward accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but they are not ſo earneſt to have grace to uſe them to Gods glory, which plainly ſhews they have not what they have in mercy. Vouchſafments &amp; injoyments longer then they are improved to Gods glory are not bleſſings &amp; mercies. Now theſe common mercies cannot be denied, ſo far as we have a ſtate cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for them &amp; grace to uſe them to the glory of the giver. We
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:168364:72"/> for our parts have no cauſe to complain, we eat &amp; drinke mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and weare them upon our backe. We have mercies above and mercies beneath us, &amp; mercies round about. If we want one kind we have it made up in another. Thou ſhalt have rubiſh to ſerve thy turne, which God throwes away; for he hath given thee gold. There is no fear of having too few cruſts, but of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good teeth to gnaw nouriſhment out of them:</p>
            <p>In the Eleventh place, this is a choiſe effect of Gods mercy, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> have communion with God. <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God and the fellowſhip of the holy ſpirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Carolus plus cum Deo quam cum hominibus loquitur.</note> Are upri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and down-lying with a gratious ſoule. This is a mercy indeed. It is ſaid of Charles the greate, that he ſpake more with God then with men. Ah Sirs, why ſhould it not be true of us? Brethren it concernes us much to look after this fruit of mercy. By this mercy we ſtand in times of temptation and triall. A ſoule high in communion with God may be tempted, but will not eaſily be conquered, ſuch a ſoule will fight it out to the death. O this is a choiſe mercy? It is <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder where you have Chriſt ſweetly comming downe into the ſoule, and the ſoule ſweetely aſcending up to Chriſt. It was a mercy vouchſafed to holy and patient <hi>Iob</hi> upon the dungil, that he knew that his redeemer lived, and behold how he conquers the Devill both in blacke and white. Communion is a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall exchange betweene Chriſt and a gratious ſoule. And of this mercy there is a continuall ground in a gratious ſoule, for either I ſhall be praying for what I want, or praiſing him for what I have, by both which I have oppertunity to keepe my acquaintance, and hold communion with the Lord my God. Communion with God brings all Gods attributes to us for our uſe upon occaſions. Great is this mercy vouchſafed to the Saints and ſervants of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, From this mercifull diſpoſition, to loſt, believing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> mankind, life everlaſting comes. He hath granted to them a life as long as his owne. Now heere I am at a loſſe. Thouſands of millions of yeeres (as holy writ teacheth us and the ſpirit maketh us to believe) is not time enough in Gods eſteem to vouchſafe fullneſſe of joy, theſe pleaſures muſt be for evermore. O this perpetuity! O this eternitie! O this life everlaſting! I conclude then that God is merciful, that mercy is an attribute
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168364:73"/> of God. Men in deſperate conditions may meete with mercy, <hi>for with the Lord there is mercy.</hi> What more deſperate condition then to be fallen in <hi>Adam's</hi> I could tell you many things of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſeries and dangers, creatures have been in, and neere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and have met with a mercifull God. <hi>Moſes</hi> like to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The male Jewiſh children to be ruined, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in time the whole nation: Cruel bondage upon them all. The heads of Gods people on the block, by <hi>Hamans</hi> plot mentioned in <hi>Heſter.</hi> The three Saints (commonly called the three Children) in the fiery furnace, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions Den. The Thief upon the Croſſe, even (as it were) droping into hell. Yet Gods mercy was ſeen in ſaving all theſe. In extremities is the Lord ſeen. Though the blow were, as it were in the giving to the whole Church by <hi>Haman,</hi> yet when the people of God made worke upon earth by prayer and humiliation, that made worke in heaven, and the iſſue of it quickly came downe. And when Chriſt will be exalted for his mercy, he will convert one upon the Gallowes, and ſave a thiefe at the laſt caſt. And therefore we may conclude upon this attribute of mercy that it is in God. That God is a God of mercy, a God full of mercy, a God that delights in mercy, a God that is ready to ſhew mercy, a God that is never weary of ſhewing mercy, a God that reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth mercy for thouſands, even for a dead lift as we ſay. And ſo I have done with the explicatory part of the point, and am next to make Uſe thereof.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

O let this ſinke downe into your hearts, that ye are nothing elſe but miſerable objects, undone creatures. And that which mightily addes thereunto is this; that many of us want eies to ſee it. Alas! men are not only miſerable but mad too: like Bedlams we can laugh and ſing when we are bound in chaines, and our friends weeping in corners for us. Ah Sirs, God's heart bleeds over us many times when we laugh and ſing it out. He ſent his Sonne to dy for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:168364:73"/> poore ſoules when they did not know their neede of him: nay he made a plaiſter of his ſonne's heart-blood for them, to heate their poore ſoules, that wickedly ſpilt it. Man is a miſerable creature, and cannot aſſure himſelfe of the leaſt good or keepe himſelfe for the leaſt evill. There is no kind of ſinne that ever was committed ſince the foundation of the world was laid, but we ſhould run into it upon every opportunitie, did not God in mercy prevent it. O what poore nothing, duſt and aſhes are we, that live as though we had no need of God; and yet cannot live one minuite without him?

            <p>Secondly, Seeing God is ſuch a mercifull God, this ſhould teach us in our afflictions and miſeries, not to diſpair, not to be <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> caſt downe as if there were no God.

Tis true God is a juſt and ſevere judge againſt the wicked: yet he gives place to his mercy, and is never ſo ſharpe in making the wound, but he is as gentle in aſſwaging the ſmart of it, and in the end takes it cleane away.

The truth is we ſhould forget none of them. Forgetfulnes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is a ſinne that goes neare to the heart of God. We find God often putting men in minde of his mercies.

Surely we of this nation have cauſe to look back to thoſe bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy daies of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and to remember what God then did, &amp; hath often ſince done for us. He put out the fires in <hi>Smithfield</hi> and elſwhere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And remember what he did for us in Eighty-eight, and concerning the Gunpower plot in 1605. And in theſe laſt paſt years, even to admiration and aſtoniſhment. O that we could remember his mercies, that have beene ever of old. Muſt we not confeſſe that the Lord hath beene to us a mercifull God? Yea ſurely: And if we look upon our ſelves that deſire to ſerve God according to the preſcribed rules of his word.

How hath God kept up a deſpiſed handfull notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the wrath, pride, profaneſſe and cruel ſpight of ſome that live among us? How hath he kept the burning buſh (his Church in this place) from being conſumed? Beſides perſonall mercies which each one his owne ſoule is moſt privy unto. Some have been ſick, and God hath reſtored health. Some have beene forced from their habitations, and God hath brought them backe again. Some have beene unjuſtly moleſted under pretence of being diſorderly perſons, peace-breakers, Riotors (how truely God will one day make appeare) and God hath yet freed you from the cruel ſpight and cruſhing might of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. Behold ye ſtand before the Lord unde many a mercy, let them never be forgotten for by remembering what God hath done, ye will be the fatter and readier to love the Lord and obey him, and praiſe him with acknowledgement that his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth forever.

As the beames of the ſunne gathered in a burning glaſſe into one, do ſtirre up and cauſe great heate ſometime fire; So the mercies of God gathered in our mind ſeriouſly conſidered, will kindle the fire of love in our ſoules towards God, and to that end let theſe three things ſtill run in our minde.

            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> The Firſt Uſe of this ſecond point (which is that mercy is a communicable attribute) is to teach us;<note place="margin">1. They that want mercy are every wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> that unmercifull men do want a very glorious, commendable and profitable thing, which may be had, and which ſome have to their everlaſting praiſe, and which they that want are every way wicked. For Firſt,<note place="margin">1. They be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteous.</note> they that be covetous men, ſhall never enter into the kingdome of Heaven. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.

            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:168364:76"/>
            <p>And then Secondly, Unmercifull men are unbelievers,<note place="margin">2. Unbelievers.</note> and ſuch ſhall be damned, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. Now that ſuch as are unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l are in deed unbelievers, may eaſily be made appear: for whereas God hath ſaid, <hi>He that giveth to the poore ſhall not want,</hi> Prov. 28.27. Theſe want faith to believe that promiſe. For did they believe it, they would act accordingly. And <hi>Faith without works is dead,</hi> Jam. 2.17. God who is truth it ſelf, hath enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to mercifull men in many promiſes, but coveteous men will believe never a one, and ſo they are unmercifull. They ſhall be without that are unbelievers. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>But the fearfull and unbelieving, &amp;c. ſhall have their part in the lake that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with fire and brimſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is alſo certain,<note place="margin">3. They have not the love of God in them.</note> that unmercifull men have not the love of God in them; for, 1 Joh. 3.17. <hi>Who ſo hath this worlds goods, and ſeeth his brother want (or to have need) and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> Such as are unmercifull men, do neither love God, nor are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This ſin hath much cruelty and unnaturalneſſe in it. For whereas <hi>the Lord is the maker of both rich and poore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. This ſin hath much cruelty and unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> Pro. 22.2. The poor are looked upon and dealt withall by the rich, as if God had not made them. Therefore <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.7. Such are ſaid, <hi>to hide themſelves from their own fleſh.</hi> And <hi>Malachy</hi> 2.10. Each man is ſaid to be brother to another. <hi>Why do we deale treacherouſly every man againſt his brother?</hi> We have a command, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.21. That <hi>if</hi> our <hi>enemies hunger,</hi> we muſt <hi>give him bread to eat, and if he be thirſty, we muſt give him water to drink.</hi> But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull men are far from hearkening to this command: Ye ſee what wicked creatures ſuch are, by all theſe particulars that I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And as they are wicked, ſo alſo they ly under a curſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.27. As, <hi>He that giveth to the poore ſhall not lack.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.

And not onely the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but God himſelf curſeth ſuch. So much is implyed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.1. For if he be <hi>bleſſed that conſidereth the poore;</hi> then by the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:168364:77"/> rule of contraries ſuch as do not are curſed. They are curſed upon this account, becauſe they are wicked. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.33. <hi>The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked.</hi> And Math. 25.41. At the laſt day they ſhall be pronounced curſed, and ſhall heare that woefull ſentence, <hi>depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devill and his Angells.</hi> The curſe of God like <hi>the Leproſy of Naaman</hi> doth <hi>cleave</hi> to them <hi>and to</hi> their <hi>ſeed for ever.</hi> Thus ye ſee this truth manifeſted by two evidences the one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from their great wickednes, the other from their curſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like God.</note>Thirdly, It appears, that unmercifull men want a glorious commendable and profitable thing, by this, that they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlike to God. O this diſſimilitude to God makes men look uggly. <hi>God is the Father of mercies.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. God loveth them that are like unto him, but ſo are not wicked men. They do not ſhew themſelves to <hi>be the children of</hi> this <hi>Father which is in heaven.</hi> We read of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10.17. That he doth <hi>hear the deſire of the humble</hi> (or poore,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that he <hi>giveth food to all fleſh</hi> becauſe <hi>his mercy endureth for ever</hi> Pſalme. 136.25. and <hi>Luc.</hi> 6.36. He commandeth <hi>that</hi> (we) <hi>be mercifull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.45.</note> 
               <hi>as</hi> (our) <hi>Father alſo is mercifull.</hi> And he made lawes for mercy. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.7, 8. <hi>If there be among you a poore man of one of thy bretheren within thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee; thou ſhalt not harden thy heart nor ſhut thy hand from thy poore brother. But thou ſhalt open thy hand wide unto him, and ſhalt ſurely lend him ſufficient for his need in that which he wanteth.</hi> And God is ſo mercifull that he takes order that <hi>the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind be called, when men make feaſts.</hi> Luke 14.13. But unmercifull men have not ſuch a diſpoſition, they are altogether unlike God and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore want a glorious property.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. Unmercifulnes bars audience of Prayers.</note>In the Forth place, we read <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Who ſo ſtoppeth his ears at the cry of the poore, he alſo ſhall cry himſelfe, but ſhall not be heard.</hi> Unmercifulnes bars audience of prayers. Certainly they want a glorious commoditie that want that which makes the eare of the Lord to be open, to cries and cals in the time of neede? Tis no ordinary priviledge to have acceſſe and welcome to the throne of grace; and therefore to want it whereby <hi>prayer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth <hi>an abhomination to the Lord</hi> muſt needs be a very great want. O when unmercifull men, hard-hearted wretches, ſhall
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:168364:77"/> ly and cry on their death beds, O Lord ſhew ſome mercy, O Lord ſhew ſome comfort, Lord help me, Lord help me, Lord forgive me, Lord Jeſus receive my ſoule: let them be ſure God will turne the deafe eare to them, as they have formerly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Oh this is dreadfull!</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Unmercifullnes is a degree of murther, <hi>Job</hi> 24.14. <hi>The murderer riſing with the light, killeth the poore and needy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5: Unmercifulnes is a kind of murther. <hi>Qui non tollit injuriam cur poteſt facit.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and in the night is as a thiefe.</hi> That place is to be underſtood of ſuch a murther as the rich man (mentioned, <hi>Luke.</hi> 16.21.) was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. He that deviſeth waies how to oppreſſe, ſuck, ſqueeze, yea not to ſuccour a dying man in Gods account, is a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. Not to give meate to the hungry hath a ſentence of, go ye curſed, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.42. If people be in miſery and want, and ſuch as are able, will not pitty and ſuccour them, and ſupply their wants, they are in a ſort before the Lord murtherers.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is a ſhrewd ſigne of a reprobate condition:<note place="margin">6. A ſhrewd ſigne of a reprobate condition.</note> For we read in the third chapter of the <hi>Colloſ.</hi> ver. 12. That bowels of mercy is put among thoſe properties which do belong to the elect of God. <hi>Put on therefore as the elect of God (holy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) bowels of mercie, kindneſſe of mind, meekneſſe, long ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c. Who can think but ſuch do belong to the ſtate of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that have not the markes and ſigne of Gods elect upon them? Who can hope that they have relation to the God of mercy, that in their place and to their power, do not labour to make it evident by relieving ſuch as be in miſery?</p>
            <p>To conclude this uſe,<note place="margin">Laſtly, their end dolefull, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull.</note> ſurely we may agree from the woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their future condition, from their dolefull end. That they want that, which is of great concernment, that want a mercifull diſpoſition. <hi>James.</hi> 2.13. <hi>For he ſhall have judgment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy.</hi> They muſt look to <hi>drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is powred out without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the cup of his indignation.</hi> Without mixture, marke that phraſe, that is without allaying of it. God will not moderate it at all. They ſhall have judgement without mercy.</p>

The bottomleſſe Ocean of Gods mercy can never poſſibly be drawne dry by the creature. Many admirable ſayings have we touching Gods mercy. Firſt God enclines to it, it comes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally from him: not as waters out of the pump but as ſhowres from heaven.

Fourthly, ye have an expreſſion <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30.18. <hi>And therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you.</hi> But what do I ſpeake of that which is infinite and incomprehenſible?

               </note> And what are our ſinnes to the mercies of God. Infinitenes cannot be limited. Gods thoughts of mercy are exalted above the thoughts of our unworthineſſe, farre higher then the heavens are exalted above the earth. Mercy is as it were Gods fetching of breath. His infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible goodnes, doth in a ſort wholy live in works of mercy; For all the world are object of Gods mercy ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall: For all have ſinned, and have come ſhort of the glory of God. That famous Man, <hi>H. Zanchius.</hi> Hath notable ſtuffe about this matter. I will take notiſe but of one paſſage, Upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. Where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Zanch. de At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trib. lib. <hi>2.</hi> c <hi>1.</hi> queſt. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> that God is ſlow to anger. He writeth, <hi>And therefore we muſt note, although anger be attributed unto God, it is in God nothing elſe, but the chiefe goodnes and juſtice, whereby he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth evill, and according to his juſt judgment, doth at lengh puniſh it, if it be not amended by his long ſuffering and patience. This here hence appeareth evidently, ſpeaking of revenge, which is an effect of anger, he doth not ſay that he doth preſently inflict puniſhment, or that he is ſo ready to inflict it as to ſhew mercy: but he ſaith, that he is ſlow to anger,</hi> &amp;c. And upon the 28th. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 21. Where the words are, for the Lord ſhall riſe up as in mount <hi>Perahim;</hi> he ſhall be wrath as in the valley of <hi>Gibion,</hi> that he may do his worke; his ſtrange worke; and bring to paſſe his acts, his ſtrange act. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (ſaith <hi>Zanchy</hi>) maketh two ſorts of Gods works, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſtrange workes. The proper worke of God is to ſhew mercy, and to ſpare or forgive; his ſtrange worke is to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and to puniſh: So farre he. I have been ſomewhat long about this quotation. The weight lieth upon this, that mercy in God is his nature, and therefore infinite; it is the very life of God, his drawing of breath in his proper works. Mercy, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:168364:79"/> long ſuffering are according to the nature of the deitie, which is farre remote from all unjuſt ſeverity, cruelty, tiranny, and pride. All providences have mercy in them. Tis of the infinite mercy of God that the world is borne up, which would elſe ſink into its firſt, nothing. It is mercy reſpites the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wicked men, and ſaves the elect; yea, behold I tell you a miſtery, mercies brings calamities. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>But when we are judged we are chaſtned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi> O let me draw breath a little! Conſider, what unexpected, even incredible mercies God ſometimes breathes out. Even when he ſeemes to breath out ſmoake and flames; yet he is angry that he may bring his work to paſſe, that is to ſay, his Proper work; that is, that he may have mercy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. The Devill he breaths out Deaths, Miſeries and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, but God loads us with mercies, and (as I ſayd) the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of goodneſſe ſets God on worke to put himſelfe out in endleſſe mercies and tender bowels, beyond what man or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell can poſſibly imagine.</p>
            <p>Learn then we may hence, that there is no want of mercy in <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> God: ſooner can the Sea want water, and Hell want fire, and torments for ungodly men; than God can want mercy. If ye be not all ſaved (O ye ſinners) it is not out of any defect in God: His bowels yern over loſt mankinde: Yee are ſelf mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers; if ye come not all to Heaven. He perſwades you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats you, begs you and complains of you; that ye will not come to him, <hi>that ye might have life.</hi> And what would ye have more? I ſay again, if any of you be damned, tis not God, but your ſelves that cauſe it. See what God hath done to others: men ſaved already next the devils, have been the greateſt objects of pitty that could be, becauſe vile ſinners and <hi>enemies to God in their mind by wicked works;</hi> bloody <hi>Manaſſeth,</hi> perſecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> abhominable <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the Thief upon the Croſſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dropping into the jaws of Hell. And for <hi>Saul</hi> who I named but juſt now, when he was <hi>breathing out threatnings and ſlaughters againſt the diſciples of the Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 9.1.</note> Even then was God breathing out his mercies upon him. Theſe are glorious ſuns that ſhine in the crown of our mercifull God. He hath mercy of all ſorts, for all conditions: and nothing diſpleaſeth him more, then when men take up narrow thoughts of his infinite bowels.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:168364:80"/>
            <p>Then ſecondly, Let us truſt in this mercifull God for ever, <label type="milestone">

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and turn to the Lord, for he is mercifull. He will have mercy, he will abundantly pardon: ſtand it not out with God any longer; ye know not if ever ye may have another ſuch a tender of mercy from God again. O then cloſe with God; labour to come into the Covenant, and keep under it ye that are in. Otherwiſe ye may live long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough under mercies offered. Come to Chriſt, God is a Father onely to ſuch as have Chriſt for their Lord and King. Beloved, conſider what I ſay, Gods works are glorious and to be ſought out. I ſay we come not to heaven in a way of mercy onely, but through a Mediator: for out of Chriſt God is nothing elſe but everlaſting burnings. For though his nature and property be to have mercy and to forgive; yet he is forced to take puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by our impenitency, and our impenitency cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, untill we be united to Chriſt by the ſpirit working re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. If ye be not in the Covenant, ye are out of the ſphear in which Gods mercics to eternal ſalvation move; though many ordinary ſhowers of mercies and Sun-blaſts of comfort, are to be had upon the account in general of the ſatisfaction of Gods juſtice by Jeſus Chriſt elſewhere; yet choice mercies, the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi> are to be had no where elſe but under the Covenant, Pſal. 89.28. Mark I pray, <hi>My mercy will I keep for him ever more:</hi> How comes that to paſſe?

And Gods mercies to us in him are firm and ſure: Verſe 34. <hi>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> And much more ye may read in the following verſes, to the ſame purpoſe. The ſum of all is, that Gods mercies in Chriſt are firm to the whol body myſtical. To them they are like the waters of <hi>Noah:</hi> Tis a Covenant of ſalt that cannot be broken. Get once aſſurance that thou art in Chriſt, and never doubt of the mercies of God more.

               </note> becauſe it is conformable according to its kind, and agreeable to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed proportion or allay; and is not falſe. The meaſure of each created thing, is that which is ſomtimes called an <hi>Idea:</hi> to wit, the divine conception of God, in himſelfe of each thing, according to which as a rule, by vertue of this conception of his, he gave being in time. For in the wiſdome of God, from everlaſting hath the form of every thing not only ſpecifically (from the higheſt Seraphim to the loweſt Ant) but in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular individuum's. If a creature ſhould be otherwiſe,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eritas eſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietas entis creati ſicut &amp; bonitas <hi>Leſſ.</hi>
               </note> then is ſo conceived in the mind of God, it ſhould not be true, but falſe. And as each thing is ſaid to be true, by its conformity to its exemplary cauſe; ſo to be good by its agreement unto its finall cauſe. And therefore we ſay truth is one, although good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be manifold, as there are many ends ſubordinate one to another: yet nevertheleſſe there is but one utmoſt end, and in that regard but one goodnes neither. There is nothing which God hath made concerning which we may ſay,<note place="margin">Natura nihil fecit fruſtra.</note> 
               <hi>it is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> For what the heathens according to their skill, ſay of nature, that it made nothing in vain; we may much more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay of God. It is agreed upon in the Church of Chriſt, that God made all things, and all perſons in particular, for certain ends whereby he may be glorified. So <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4</note> 
               <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelfe; yea, even the wicked for the day of evill.</hi> And look as a thing ſerves more to declare the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of God; ſo it is ſaid to have in it more goodneſſe. Take all the jewells in the world, they have not in them that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:168364:82"/> in a true conſideration that hath one blade of graſſe, which hath life, though of the loweſt ſort, yet it hath life. Graſſe and plants, not ſo good as ſenſitives that have a better kind of life. Lions and Eagles nothing comparable to the pooreſt man. And (to ſpeake in the words of <hi>Chryſoſtome) Take all the men in the world, and they are not worth one Saint or gracious ſoule, though never ſo meane in regard of outwards.</hi> And what's the reaſon of this, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they are they by whom God attaines his end of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the world; and from them alone hath his glory in the world. <hi>And therefore I conclude, the righteous is more excellent then his neighbour.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Duae proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates entis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; bonum.</note> There is a greater goodnes, better a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the end of being.</p>
            <p>Ye ſee the two poſitive properties of an entitie; the trueth of it, and the goodnes of it. But it may be demanded, whether onenes or unitie be not another propertie of an entitie or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? To which I anſwer, No. Becauſe the oneneſſe of a thing, addes nothing unto the being of that thing;<note place="margin">Unitas ſuprà rationem entis nihil dicit niſi diviſionis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationem. <hi>Leſſ.</hi> veritas uniuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cujuſque rei eſt proprietas ſui eſſe, <hi>Avicen. &amp; vigue. Grav. Inſtituit. f. 8.</hi>
               </note> neither doth it affirme any thing, ſave oneneſſe which is a negation of diviſion. For that which is one, is a thing undivided, &amp; divided from all other things: And therefore hath no place among properties: But I haſten from theſe notions leſt I ſhould offend the judicious: I have ſpoken of the property of goodnes, as it is attributed to God, and now to ſpeak of truth; though this be not that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the word, which I purpoſe moſt to inſiſt upon. Yet take this by the way. Our God is a true God, that is, he is truly God. But here it may be objected, if truth be a conformity of a being unto its rule: or as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, a true ſimilitude of the beginning, which is without any diſſimilitude: what rule is there for God to be conformed unto? To which I anſwer. Truth as it is (in this firſt acceptation) attributed to God, is not in him a conformity of being, to a rule or pattern, (for then God ſhould not be eternall,<note place="margin">Veritas eſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſimilitudo principii, quae ſine ulla diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudine eſt. <hi>Aug. de vera religione.</hi>
               </note> and ſomething ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, according to which his entitie being conforme, ſhould make him a true God:) but in this, that his nature is ſuch as that it ought to be, the exemplary cauſe and meaſure of all things. This being of God then is <hi>veritas fundamentalis</hi> (as the Schoolmen call it.) In this ſence he is the true God, and there is no other beſides him. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45.22. <hi>I am God, and there is none elſe.</hi> This ſhewes the falſenes of all other Gods, and of all other religions. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.11. The Lord threatens <hi>Idolaters,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:168364:82"/> to famiſh all their gods.</hi> Jehovah the true God <hi>will make hungry falſe gods.</hi> For his truth endureth for ever; neither can his true being ceaſe: nor his meate whereupon he liveth be taken from him. But ye will ſay, what meaneſt this?<note place="margin">What meat God eateth?</note> What meat is that which God which is a Spirit eateth? To which I anſwer. God is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and liveth in ſeeking his own honour, which none can take from him, though thouſands go about it. He is a jealous God, and his honour he will not give to another. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch as deny the true God his due honor and worſhip, do what they can to famiſh him; yet it is impoſſible, he will live and be glorified in deſpight of men and Devils. It is true of all other dunghill gods, God will famiſh them: for when the word comes to be preached among nations, it turnes them from falſe gods to worſhip the living God: and ſo God is ſaid to famiſh falſe gods. As take all the religions that ever have beene in the world, beſides that which we profeſſe; take all the gods that have beene ſet up by others, before or ſince Chriſt; they are all famiſhed and even their own worſhippers and writers have ſaid enough to make them vaine and rediculous. But our God, the God of Chriſtians is the true God. When things come to looſe their eſteeme, their leaneſſe riſeth up and they goe downe: As it is with man, his leanneſſe may be ſaid to riſe when his credit fals. But what an horrible ſinne is this to go about to ſtarve God; as all they do, that do deny unto him due honour and worſhip? But who do ſo? Sirs, I will ſpeake no more of the gods of the Gentiles; thoſe dead vanities are long agone explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: nor of the abſurd religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> with his barbarous <hi>Alcoron</hi> ſo full of non-ſence. Nay I can ſcarſe afford a looke to <hi>Rome,</hi> in thoſe things wherein we have left them; for our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is only about what men have added. But O ye Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants that are taught to know and worſhip the true God, and live under the profeſſion of the true religion: to you I have ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing to ſay of great concerment. Are not ſome of you profane and ſuperſtitious, and very ignorant of this true God, which we preach unto you? Nay are not moſt of your miniſters (at leaſt round about us) ſuch? What meaneth elſe, ſuch hunting after benefices, ſuch chopping of places, ſuch doings about prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the world? And then no marvell people generally are ſo cold, formall, perfunctory and ſuperſtitious in worſhip;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:168364:83"/> and ſo vain, looſe, worldly, and profane in their converſation.</p>
            <p>Now I beſeech you all, conſider whether it be anſwerable to the true worſhip of the true God (which ye profeſſe to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to know and practiſe) to be careleſſe of worſhip preſcribed by Chriſt, ſuperſtitiouſly zealous about additions and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men; and looſe and worldly in converſation and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Well I will not ſay much. We ſhould cleave to this God whoſe <hi>truth endureth to all generations,</hi> even in this firſt ſence, that he is true and not falſ. And therefore all that prophane, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſuperſtitious people make their god; and love, honour, eſteeme and truſt unto; ſhall be dealt withall as the gods of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.12. <hi>And againſt all the gods of Aegypt, I will execute judgement: I am the Lord.</hi> Let a good principle therefore be laid and then though religion, and peace, and proſperity, ſhould not walke in one path (as yet by the goodnes of God they do;) yet ye will cleave to the true God. But though ye have all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happineſſe, much of the word and of the earth, which is ſo much deſired and eſteemed: yet if ye <hi>have not much earth</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, <hi>Marke</hi> 4.5. If ye want roote; ye will at laſt come to nothing. Yea, This true God will famiſh all your gods that ye have truſted too, and make their leanneſſe to ariſe, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the honour and credit which was given and to your forms and formall blind guides. And this is done already according to the propheſy <hi>Malachy.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Therefore have I alſo made you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and baſe before all the people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Greenhill</hi> on Ezekiel 1. part p. 47.</note>

We have plenty of theſe Chanel-ſcrapers and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:168364:83"/> dirt-throwers: yea ſome of them Miniſters at leaſt ſo called and accounted, have learned of <hi>Zedekiah to ſmite Michajah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 22.24.</note> &amp;c. But yet alas! Have not we our ſelves beene perfidious to God and men, and gone about to rob him of thoſe ſouls, which he ſent us to get into him? I am loath to ſay what I know and obſerve; only pray you to read, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9.16. <hi>For the leaders of this people cauſe them to erre, and they that are ledde of them are deſtroyed.</hi> We may not therefore wonder that our leaneſſe doth ſo ariſe: If we go about to famiſh God, God will famiſh us. And (to make an end of this point,) let all know, that if they give that love, truſt, reſpect and honour which is due to God unto creatures, which he hath made, and <hi>love the world and the things that are in the world;</hi> it is a ſigne they have <hi>not received this anointing, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to know the true God,</hi> &amp;c. Which to do <hi>is life eternall.</hi> And while the men of the world brag that they have friends, wealth, riches and honour; Let the people of God, give God his meat and honour him, and ſay we have a God: Even as the ſtory goes of the French Herauld, when the many titles of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> were reckoned up (which indeed were many:) He cauſes theſe words King of France to be ſaid over and over as often; intimating thereby, that one <hi>France</hi> was better then all thoſe petty Kingdomes and Lordſhipps; and (that) (one) ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more honourable. So we ſee <hi>David</hi> ſtarving and famiſhing all the gods. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſſe in my heart, more then in the time that their corne and their wine increaſed.</hi> Thus he makes the leanneſſe of the gods of worldlings and fooliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (that know not the true God) to appeare. And ſo much for the firſt acceptation of the word True, and the application of it to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who is the only true God, and that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally without conformity to a rule.</p>
            <p>But neither the word in my Text uſed <hi>(Emunatho)</hi> nor the ſcope of the place, nor indeed the ſubject I intend in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe; is for this acceptation of the word truth. Therefore we muſt ſeeke another. Therefore, Secondly, (leaving this object and fundamentall verity, this cheif intelligible, among all intelligibles, the firſt &amp; ſupream meaſure of all meaſurables; in whom every intelligible and meaſurable, is moſt eminently contained, as in the bottomleſſe depth of all truth, and the firſt determinating and modifying rule of all things:) We
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:168364:84"/> have another truth, to wit, formall truth. This is the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of knowledge, with the object, as with its meaſure, when a thing is judged ſuch as indeed it is: when our knowledge ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines its object, this is truth. This truth alſo is attributed to God, whoſe knowledge attaines it due object, and his wiſdom infinitely ſurpaſſeth all created wiſdome. <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men that they are vaine.</hi> Vaine and falſe thoughts lodg in men, none in God: we may ſay of men, ye miſſe thinke, and ye ſay falſe; we cannot ſay ſo of God. I ſpeake not of lying againſt conſcience, but of comming ſhort of the truth, of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking truth and taking falſehood for it: we make uſe of two words, concerning learned men and opinions, which will help much to the underſtanding of this logical truth: <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Heterodox:</hi> an <hi>Orthodox</hi> man, is one that is ſound in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and holds the truth, and doth not take errours inſtead of truth: When there is a conformitie of the conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ptions of the mind with things, as they are, this makes a man <hi>Orthodox.</hi> But a <hi>Heterodox</hi> man is one that apprehendeth otherwiſe of things then they are; I take it, that place <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. Is to be underſtood of this truth. <hi>Yea, let God be true, but every man a lyer.</hi> Who then is an <hi>Orthodox</hi> divine? ſurely ſuch a one as thinkes of things held forth to be known, as they are. Thus ye have a ſecond uſe of the word truth as it is the Engliſh of the Hebrew word <hi>Keſhet</hi> or <hi>Koſht:</hi> In which acceptation alſo; God is true truly conceiving and ennunciating things as they are. That ye may be full of this in your underſtanding, conſider that if all the holy and excellent men that ever were in the world, or are, or ſhall be, were brought together; we might ſay of many thouſands (as was ſaid of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt,<note place="margin">John 5.35.</note> 
               <hi>he was a burning and a ſhining lamp:</hi>) They were and are <hi>Orthodox</hi> and true judging men: but we cannot ſay of ſo much as one, all that he holds, or beleeveth, or ſayeth, is true. For this only is proper to God, who only is compleatly <hi>Orthodoxe:</hi> of men we muſt ſay (as <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth <hi>in many things, we offend all</hi>) In many things we erre, and do not hold the truth, even every one, even the moſt ſound and moſt knowing Chriſtian or Miniſter that ever was. The firſt kind of truth, was (as I may call it) Metaphyſicall truth, whereby things are truly, what they ſeem or are conceived or reputed to be, having the reality of that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:168364:84"/> which they have the name of: But this truth (which I have called logicall) is the knowing and ſaying of things in mind and tongue, as the truth is. In this ſence the Scriptures are the Scriptures of truth, and in them is no ly nor errour. And ſo God only, I ſay, is the true God, or the God of truth. But although God be in this regard the only true God, and the God of all truth; from the truth of whoſe divine wiſdome all truths deſcend to men and Angels: Yet the truth of things which he knoweth, do not paſſe from the things into his knowledge, as the meaſure thereof, as in men (ye know) things are true, and therefore afterwards known ſo to be: But in God from the objective verity of his eſſence, two manner of wayes do the knowledge of things true in themſelves, come to be ſaid to be true, in regard of God. Firſt, by Creation, for by wiſdome all things are made and formed; their truth doth conſiſt in their conformity with that wiſdome and divine art. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24. <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works? in wiſdome haſt thou made them all:</hi> Now to endeavour to make you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſomwhat, of this comming of things to be true: ye muſt know that in regard of us, truth paſſeth into our knowledge; becauſe the truth of things (as I ſaid before) is the meaſure of the truth of our knowledge: Therefore what thing is Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſically falſe, an enunciation logicall thereof cannot be true. But there is neceſſarily required a truth of the thing before I come to know it to be ſo. And ſo after, truth paſſeth from my knowledge into my affections, and ſo into my manners and converſation, in as much as they are ſubject to the judgement, wiſdome and knowledge of the divine law. And laſtly, it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for truth into our words and writings, in which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the leaſt footſteps, the ſmalleſt ſound, and (as it were) the laſt farwell of truth. Now in God whoſe wiſdome, infinitely ſurpaſſeth all wiſdome, every notion of truth is moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained, his wiſdome and knowledge attaining and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating moſt perfectly and moſt diſtinctly every objective truth. And this formall truth in God (as well as we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it) ariſeth in God from the objective truth of his eſſence; which is the meaſure of divine wiſdome: and the truth of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſtandeth in conformity or adequation with his eſſence, and conſequently with all things which in it are eminently contained.</p>
            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:168364:85"/>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas truth deſcends from God, unto crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by revelation and divine illuſtration; for this truth is not drawn from the objects, but directly communicated by the infuſion of light: (in which manner the truth of faith and the bleſſed viſion of God, is derived unto us:) In God it is not ſo. For he is not only the firſt object and fundamentall truth, but alſo the formall truth, the very univerſalitie and fullnes of wiſdome, and ſo he comprehends without revelation all truths by reaſon of his infinite knowledge: For more then twenty yeares, I could not perceive how a man could be in judgement an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and in truth an underſtanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: as ye will confeſſe (I am perſwaded) with me, that are not unreaſonably engaged in thoſe controverſies, or miſerably entangled in thoſe ſnares of unſanctified witts; the deſciples of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Plato;</hi> Not of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Faine would I have anſweres to theſe few enſuing queſtions, that I may have a better opinion (if it be meete I ſhould) of that ruffling generation, that are gotten into theſe Arminian tenents. Firſt, whether God Foreknew this truth from eternity, of each Sonne and Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, perſonally, and by name, that ſuch a one, and ſuch a one, ſhould beleeve and be ſaved; and ſuch, and ſuch remaine in unbeliefe and be damned? Secondly, (according to the matter in hand which put me upon this digreſſion) whether this were firſt a truth before God knew it, and ſo paſſed into the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God,<note place="margin">Tam impoſſibile eſt Deum falli circa rem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutiſſimam: (verbi gratia circa cogitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes aut inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones cordis humani, &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus ejus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantias) quam eſt ipſo ſcribite illum falli circa pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priam eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, <hi>Leſſ. de perf. div. 50.</hi>
               </note> as the Metaphyſicall truth of the thing, to cauſe a logicall truth in Gods underſtanding? Thirdly, in general, whether the intitive knowledge of God, extending it ſelfe to creatures, may in any ſort be ſaid, or thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and draw truth from them; ſo as to move the divine mind, and to forme knowledge in it? Fourthly, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in God, betweene his foreknowledge and purpoſe? Fifthly, whether it can ſtand with the wiſdom of God to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſalvation alike to all, and yet to know that only ſuch, and ſuch, as he foreknew ſhould receive it. Sixthly, What difference there is in God between knowledge and foreknowledge? And when I ſhall be ſatisfied about theſe quaeries (which I ſuppoſe wil not ſoon be done) I ſhall perhaps encline to think <hi>Pelagians, Arminians</hi> (Generaliſts as they now would be called) have taken
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:168364:85"/> paines to know God according to Scripture diſcoveries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his infinite, al-knowing, al-ordering, al-wiſe,<note place="margin">Quid eſt prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia futuro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum? quid au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem futurum eſt Deo, quia om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſupergredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur tempora?

            <p>But to go on a little more upon this logicall ſort of truth; in things that are not <hi>in eſſe,</hi> there is not properly truth, but it may be there; before the world was made, man was not in himſelfe true man, nor ſubſtance, nor being; but only he might be theſe: that is, it was not contrary to that objective concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is apprehended in the formall notion of a man; and abſtracted from both, <hi>eſſe actu, &amp; non eſſe:</hi> But in the divine intellect, and by his eternall notion; by which all things are apprehended and formed; the <hi>totum eſſe</hi> of all things, was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but to be underſtood to be faſhioned and formed in the divine intellect.</p>
            <p>But things may be ſaid to be poſſible, or in <hi>poſſe eſſe,</hi> in a double reſpect.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as it were from an intrinſecall potentialitie, which is no other thing, but a <hi>non-repugnancy,</hi> by meanes hereof, although there be nothing, and that it have in it nothing of entity; yet it is not repugnant to them to be and to have a true entitie ſhape and form.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a thing may be ſaid to be poſſible by extrinſecall denomination, from the divine power and wiſdom, by which they may be brought forth in to beeing: Therefore as in theſe, there is no actuall entitie, but only poſſible; ſo no actual truth but one poſſible: and this wholy how little-ſoever dependeth upon divine veritie. For that the objective conceptions of things, or the things which are ſaid to be poſſible, may be truly things, and have a true entitie and form; commeth herehence, that the divine eſſence is imitable in thoſe manners and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: and by the ſame wiſdome, with which they were concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they may be made and formed.</p>
            <p>Ye ſee then truth in God, is the firſt root from whence all truth is hatched and derived, to all other things, whether exiſting, or not exiſting: and that divine wiſdom is the meaſure of all obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive veritie in created things:<note place="margin">In oculis divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae ſapientiae no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Beraeans are juſtly commended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not inſtantly believe thoſe things which they heard from the Apoſtles themſelves, but firſt ſearched the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to ſee whether they were ſo or no.

            <p>This truth I ſay will ſtand when all that oppoſe it or ſlight it ſhall fall, and ſuch as doubt of it ſhall be without.<note place="margin">Fides depene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</note>

Proofs are plentifull in the hiſtory of the Scriptures: Gods truth and faithfullnes is the ground of the Saints ſecurity and the ſinners deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And this muſt needs be in God, who firſt knows what hee ſaies to be good and fit, and truth in a logicall ſence (of which ye have already heard) and therefore he need not repent: he hath no after thoughts.</p>

            <p>Now what God ſaith, is either by way of menace or promiſe, as may be abundantly read in Scripture; and of both it is true,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:168364:87"/> as it is written of the law, Mat. 5.18. <hi>One jot or title ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from it,</hi> till all be fulfilled. God watcheth over his word to perform it: It is a note of Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> upon the fifth verſe of the firſt of <hi>Zachary; Your fathers, where are they? and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, do they live for ever?</hi> That the power of Truth of Gods word depends not on any mens perſons, nor is limited to one age. Their Fathers were dead, that were threatned, and the Prophets were dead too, that did threaten them: but the truth of their propheſies was not buried with them, but was in every point fulfilled, according to their preaching: That follows, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>But my words and my ſtatutes, which I commanded my ſervants the Prophets, did they not take hold of your Fathers? And they returned and ſaid, like as the Lord of hoaſts thought to do unto us, according to our ways according to our doings, ſo hath he dealt with us.</hi> It is confeſſed by them ſelves; the hand of God upon them did draw a confeſſion from them, that they were puniſhed, as God had threatned, &amp; as they had deſerved: and they returned, that is, were convinced, better adviſed: as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Then ſhall ye return and diſcern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not.</hi> Men will know one day to their ſorrow, that God is a God of truth: not a word goes out of his mouth, but is exactly performed. Yea, circumſtances exactly obſerved: ye find <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. a promiſe made to <hi>Abram,</hi> that after foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares his ſeed ſhould be freed, and come out of the land of Bondage with great ſubſtance; And compare that place with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. And ye ſhall find great exactnes: <hi>And it came to paſſe at the end of the foure hundred and thirty yeares, even the ſelfe ſame day, it came to paſſe, that all the hoſts of the Lord went out of the land of Aegypt.</hi> The Lord is moſt true, yea truth it ſelfe: <hi>And all his promiſes in Chriſt are yea and Amen.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. He is a <hi>faithfull witnes,</hi> and whatſoever he hath ſpoken, ſhall be accompliſhed; ſo that though the heavens decay and wax old like a garment; though the ſunne loſe his light, and the moone be turned into blood; though the earth tremble and quake, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mountaines be moved and ſhake; yea though hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and all things therein contained periſh and paſs a way; yet all that God hath threatned, or promiſed, ſhall be accompliſhed: God is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> he hath his eſſence and beeing in and from himſelfe alone, giveth beeing unto all things elſe; eſpecially to his word and promiſes.</p>

               </label> or from miſapplying of them. Concerning the firſt, ye muſt know, that ſome promiſes are made with condition and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: As aſſurance of ſalvation, peace of conſcience, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings: Now many poore ſoules that enjoy not theſe promiſes, often call in queſtion Gods truth, or their own
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:168364:88"/> good eſtate at leaſt: not conſidering that God may be true, and we gratious and in Chriſt: though neither aſſurance, nor peace of conſcience, nor temporal favours be our portion. For theſe promiſes have conditions and limitations: Such as will have aſſurance, muſt <hi>give diligence to make</hi> their <hi>calling and election ſure:</hi> And ſuch as will have peace of conſcience,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> muſt have care to walke exactly, according to rule. <hi>As many as walke according to this rule, peace be on them,</hi> &amp;c.

No marvail then, ye are ſo forward to charge God, ye miſunderſtand thing, ye erre, not conſidering the promiſes with their limitations. And likewiſe miſapplication of promiſes, cauſeth much miſchief: for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are miſapplied, ſometimes to Perſons, ſomtimes to ſtate and behaviour: For the former we read, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. of ſome that complained of want of care in God, to reward them that ſerved him. They ſaid, <hi>it was vain to ſerve God;</hi> and asked, <hi>what profit</hi> there was to have <hi>kept his ordinances, &amp;c.</hi> They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not, that ſome are called Jews onely, and that he is not a Jew, that is one outwardly onely. The promiſe is not made to the ceremony, but to the ſubſtance of Religion. Many think themſelves Gods children, who are not ſo: Now ſhall God be charged for want of truth, concerning ſuch as he never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed any thing unto? O ſtudy to make your calling and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure, and to finde that ye are the children of the promiſe: Likewiſe ye that are the children of God indeed, muſt take heed how ye be careleſſe of childe-like converſation. For many times though ye be ſons and daughters, yet if ye break out into ſcandalous ſins, or be proud of your graces, or negligent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout cheriſhing Ordinances, and ſo faile in your due qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and demeanour; ye may finde God otherwiſe in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations towards you then he would be, if it were not your fault. But if we be well inſtructed in Gods nature and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with his people, and with hypocrites; and carefull to get good evidence of our ſincerity; ſuch as will not ſhrink in the wetting; and alſo to walk exactly, and be kept in a good <hi>decorum:</hi> We may be ſure, all good things promiſed ſhall be performed accordingly, ſeem Devils, men and nature never

            <p>And now let us make ſome Uſe of the truth of Gods threats <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> and menaces; let ſinners know that the God of truth hath ſaid, ye ſwore againſt ſome of them, Pſal. 95.11. <hi>

Firſt, to God; for as God hath bound himſelf to us by promiſe, ſo we have covenanted our obedience to him: Remember therefore your Baptiſme, and take heed of walking looſly in the Covenant. And ſecondly, to man, we are bound to ſupport the credit of fidelity, though with loſſe: What a ſhame is it for ſuch as profeſſe themſelves Chriſtians, to be like the Jews, in <hi>Jeremy</hi> cap. 9.4, 5. <hi>Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and truſt ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly ſupplant, and every neighbor will walk with ſlanders.

The ſtory is obvious: It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtoried of the ancient Romans that they were very conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in obſerving their leagues, covenants, and oathes. And ſuch as violated them (ſaith mine author) were held for dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and curſed creatures, and accounted worthy to live in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety: Be carefull of your promiſes, and covenants that ye make with men: God is a God of truth, do ye be men of truth: It is a communicable attribute, it is to be had: and this muſt now be ſpoken of in the ſecond place, &amp;c. Ye know we have done in handling the other attributes: this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition. That truth is a communicable attribute.</p>
            <p>For God did communicate it to <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, it was a part of that uprightneſſe mentioned, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29.

For God lookes and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the converſation of his ſervants to be anſwerable to their vocation, he maketh them to be men of truth and faithfulnes. And ſuch as are otherwiſe be of the devill. <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>Who abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him.</hi> Such are not

Wherefore this being the ſcope of the former verſe, that God will be as good as his word, and true and faithfull in all his ſayings; it maketh nothing againſt the point we have in hand. And for the other paſſage in the 13. verſe of the ſame chapter, It ſhewes (as well as the former) mans naturall inclination until he be regenerated. But it may be further objected.

            <p>To which I Anſwer.

And therefore we muſt take the extent of this communicated attribute or property, and we ſhall find, that no man hath it ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in its extent, but only ſuch as are regenerated. For it ſignifieth and comprehendeth three things. Sinceritie, a due proportion of a thing, and ſtability and firmeneſſe.<note place="margin">In hoc genere tria potiſſimum hujus vocabuli ſignificata eſſe videri que aut alias enim ſignificat animum, ejuſque cogitationes &amp; actiones ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceras minique fucatas: alias ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae ſeu juſtae cujuſdam quantitatis: alias denique certas ratas, ac per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manentes.

               </note> So God doth not only do what he ſaith, but loveth the truth, and hateth hypocriſie. God is truly, and ſincerely, and conſtantly, all that he is in his excellencies. Now it is impoſſible for the compleateſt morall man in the world that hath not the work of the new birth, to walke before God in truth in this ſence.

And it is an evident ſigne that there is but little true religion going, becauſe there is ſo little truth and honeſty going. But where there is deceitfull dealing, and want of truth and honeſty, men may take it for a truth, that they have no religion, and that they have not ſought to God from whom this good gift and all others come. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> And therefore in the next place, ye muſt learne to ſeeke for this qualitie at the hand of God by prayer, as in the former attributes, ye have been directed. And to that end that ye may be ſtirred up the more to pray for it, do but conſider how ill it becomes chriſtians to be more falſe then heathens, and to be like to the devill, and to overthrow humane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty what in them lyeth, and to procure inevitable wrath upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As we have two famous examples in ſcripture. The firſt of <hi>Saul</hi> mentioned in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.2. Who <hi>ſought to ſlay the Gibeonites in his zeal to the children of Iſrael and Judah,</hi> and ſo to violate the oath which <hi>the children of Iſrael had ſworne to them.</hi> Ye ſee God was angry, a famine of three yeares came upon the people, and an attonement muſt be made by <hi>the hanging up of ſeven of</hi> Sauls <hi>ſonnes unto the Lord in Gibeah of</hi> Saul, ver. 6. And the other place is <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 17.15, 16. Where grievouſly doth the Lord threaten the rebellious houſe (as he calls <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) and their king, for falſenes and covenant breaking. We have touched upon this before <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> now, and therefore ſhall ſay the leſſe of it now. The third and laſt uſe to be made is. That honeſt men may take comfort: though they be thought too honeſt to live in the world, and have not the trick of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoneſt, falſe, and unfaithfull dealing, (whereby ſo many get eſtates for their poſterity to ruffle in while they lye in H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll:) yet they ſhall be no looſer by it at laſt: God will bleſſe the houſe and ſeed of ſuch as are like unto him, <hi>Men of truth, hating coveteouſneſſe,</hi> and dealing truly are Gods delight: for ſuch fear God, whereas knaves, and falſe men, are odious both to God and men. And ſo much briefly for the ſecond Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that truth is a communicable attribute.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Propoſ.</hi>
               </note> The third comes in hand <hi>that God in this (as in the reſt) is infinite and incomprehenſible.</hi> His faithfullnes reacheth to the clouds, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.5. He never broke with any in his life. For his faithfullnes is eſſentiall: when God ſhall not be true of his word he ſhall be God no more. The beſt of friends may prove unfriendly, and be like a broken reede of Aegypt: men are but men and ſo they act: there is no repoſe upon the wiſdome, affection, word, of the creature: they are mutable and liable to temptations, and may faile of their purpoſes and promiſes, which yet ought not ſo to be: But God will not leave,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:168364:90"/> faile, or forſake. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>For he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee.</hi> He is the Amen, <hi>and all his promiſes in Chriſt are yea and Amen.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. To eternity and without alteration, he is faithfull and true, and that eſſentially. God is immutably what he is, and therefore muſt needs be true; but his immutability is a ſingularity, it is proper to God and communicable to no creature. God alſo is eternal and by him all things are defined and determined and muſt ſtand and be without the leſt alteration. Let this for every bear up the ſpirits of the Saints againſt all falſe dealings of men, God is faithfull: And eſpecialy in ſuch times <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> as theſe, wherein God ſeemeth to have forgotten to honour thoſe that honour him. As the <hi>foot</hi> of his enemies <hi>ſhall ſlide in due time;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37 5, 6. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord: truſt alſo in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſſe: and he ſhall bring forth thy righteouſnes as the light, and thy judgement as the noone day.</hi> God is not only true but truth it ſelfe. Nay this is a ſore affliction that ſomtimes befalleth the Saints, that good men diſagree from God about truth touching things and perſons. I ſay this is a great affliction to ſome miſjudged Saints. But Gods truth will ſtand, and in due time, it ſhall be fulfilled: and then ſhall be brought to paſſe the ſaying that is written, <hi>verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</hi> Pſalm 58.11.<note place="margin">Mr. Caryl upon Job.</note> Give leave a little to ream my heart. The beſt of men may ſomtimes be undervalued, and that by good men. There is no judging of men or matters now a dayes by what is ſaid of them: ſhould we, how contemptible would many pretious ſouls appeare to us! But ſith God hath promiſed honour and eſteem to his ſervants, how comes it to paſſe that they have ſuch evill favoured faces? I Anſwer, ſomtimes by their outward condition of lowneſs, and where the ſtile is low every one will go over; ſomtimes men that in their pride do not care what they ſay or do; do ſo be dabble them; yea ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch ugly vizards as men not only evill, but good put upon them do cauſe the Saints to be in great contempt: But God (ſaith mine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) will trim up his Saints in due time, as he did <hi>Job:</hi> his truth will ſtand however, for truth it ſelfe cannot ly or be deceived in what it hath promiſed or ſaid. But me thinks I here ſome poore diſtreſſed gratious ſoule ſay, promiſes of temporall things are made 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. As well as of thoſe things that do belong to the life to come. But for their part they are even faint in expectation, &amp;c. O deare ſirs, conſider no thing is ſo ſure as that all that God ſaith is true: But ye muſt take all truths together, and then ye will ſee that it is not want of truth in God, but of wit in you, that maketh you ſo to be perplexed. Take the promiſes
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:168364:91"/> of temporalities with their intended <hi>modus</hi> (as one ſaith) and ye ſhall ſee they are all exactly performed. For Firſt, God having many wheels to turn, muſt order things ſo that he may work all his will and fulfill all his mind. Therefore he reſerveth a power to himſelfe to try the graces of his ſervants in and out among, as he dealt with <hi>Job, And ſo gives a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold with perſecutions. Mark</hi> 10.30. Sometimes he chaſtiſeth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular delinquencies of his children: For it is intended that we ſhould demeane our ſelves as becomes Gods children, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.31, 32. alſo there is a limitation of expediency implyed, viz. ſo far as outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts may advance our ſpirituall good. So thought <hi>Agur,</hi> and made his prayer accordingly,<note place="margin">Spirituall bleſſings of two ſorts</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Give neither poverty nor riches, feede me with foode convenient from me.</hi> And yet again, God doth not alwaies pay his debts in kind, but in equivalents, and ſometimes in things of farre greater worth and value. But ſure it is, that never went there a word from God, in the fulfilling whereof he ever failed or ever ſhall, or indeed can: it is impoſſible. Here I might be large about the truth of God, touching ſpirituall bleſſings, which are not all of one ſort, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not all alike abſolutely promiſed. Some are qualifications and ſome are rewards. Faith, repentance, hope and love are abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the elect in Chriſt, but yet their perfection is not in this life to be expected, nor a freedome from mixture with their imperfections pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. Faith and doubting may ſtand together in a gratious ſoul. And many more conſiderable truthes there be that might here be brought in. Peace of conſcience, comfort in believing, joy of the holy Ghoſt, are not abſolutely promiſed, nor generally given. And ſometimes it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us to have the feare of Gods great name, then peace of conſcience. But. Secondly (to make an end of this ſubject) I would preſent a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <label type="milestone">

Your ſeeming glory and proſperity and power. O ungodly ones, may make ye ſeeme as it were impregnable; but truth hath ſaid, ye ſhall be overthrown and periſh: worldlings and vain men that fear not God ſhall leave their pompe ſhortly with woe and weale away, for truth that never failed hath ſpoken it. Let none therefore faint becauſe of the forbearance that they ſee about performing of promiſes, or ſuch other depthes, and darkeneſſes as are about this point. And let none harden their hearts againſt threatned judgments: which to do is no leſs then Blaſphemy, becauſe Truth in God is God himſelfe.</p>
